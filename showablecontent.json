Is Nintendo now bigger than Sony? And does it even make sense to compare the two? <\/p><p>On Tuesday, Nintendo shares finished trading another 14% higher, meaning they have doubled in value since the launch of Pokemon Go on 6 July. <\/p><p>This puts Nintendo's overall market value at 4.36tn yen ($38bn; \u00a328.8bn), topping Sony by 300bn yen.<\/p><div id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n    <div>\n        \n    <\/div>\n<\/div><p>And all this before Pokemon Go's even hit the streets in Nintendo's home market. (It has so far rolled out across North America and Europe, but only launches in Japan on Friday.)<\/p><p>So, is the company's increased valuation justified? <\/p><p>\"The very easy answer is yes,\" says Gerhard Fasol of Eurotechnology in Tokyo. \"If the market thinks that's what a company is worth, then yes, it is justified.\" <\/p>                                                                                                    <p>After all, it is market value we're talking about.<\/p><h2>'Huge potential'<\/h2><p>But you have to go one step further, Fasol cautions, and ask whether these companies are actually comparable.<\/p><p>\"Pokemon still has huge potential - just think of the intellectual property rights to the characters for instance,\" he explains. \"A massive potential waiting to be harvested.\"<\/p><p>It is a key characteristic of the gaming industry that the success and performance of a game is extremely hard to predict and foresee. <\/p><figure><div>\n            <figure data-playable=\"{\"settings\":{\"counterName\":\"news.business.story.36833916.page\",\"edition\":\"Domestic\",\"pageType\":\"eav2\",\"uniqueID\":\"36833916\",\"ui\":{\"locale\":{\"lang\":\"en-gb\"}},\"externalEmbedUrl\":\"http:\\\/\\\/www.bbc.co.uk\\\/news\\\/business-36833916\\\/embed\",\"insideIframe\":false,\"statsObject\":{\"clipPID\":\"p0415b9g\"},\"playlistObject\":{\"title\":\"The BBC's Chris Foxx took to the streets to explore some of the app's highs and lows\",\"holdingImageURL\":\"http:\\\/\\\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\\\/images\\\/ic\\\/$recipe\\\/p0415c1w.jpg\",\"guidance\":\"\",\"simulcast\":false,\"liveRewind\":false,\"embedRights\":\"allowed\",\"items\":[{\"vpid\":\"p0415b9n\",\"live\":false,\"duration\":95,\"kind\":\"programme\"}],\"summary\":\"The BBC's Chris Foxx took to the streets to explore some of the app's highs and lows\"}},\"otherSettings\":{\"advertisingAllowed\":true,\"continuousPlayCfg\":{\"enabled\":false},\"isAutoplayOnForAudience\":false}}\"><\/figure><\/div>\n    <figcaption><span>Media caption<\/span>The BBC's Chris Foxx took to the streets to explore some of the app's highs and lows<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>And any surge of the kind that Nintendo has seen warrants caution, analysts warn. <\/p><p>\"We're in bubble territory now - the stock's vertiginous rally may not last,\" says Neil Wilson of ETX Capital. \"It's broken so far clear of any support levels that a fall could be nasty for those who bought into the rally.\"<\/p><p>The phenomenal success of Pokemon Go has surprised even seasoned market players. Nintendo certainly was hoping for a hit, but even it must have been somewhat caught off guard by the frenzy its little virtual creatures have created around the globe. <\/p><p>It's a surprise success but one that if sustained can have a transforming impact on the fortunes of the company. <\/p><h2>What's a Walkman? <\/h2><p>What does a firm like Sony have that could compete in terms of market impact? It's known mostly as a hardware company and a very successful and solid one.<\/p><p>\"The last time that Sony had a hit that could maybe be compared to Pokemon was probably the Walkman,\" Fasol points out. <\/p><p>The Walkman may seem like just yesterday to some, but to most Pokemon players you'd probably have to explain that it was a portable cassette player in the 1980s. And then you'd have to explain to them what a cassette was. <\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Walkman\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/106E8\/production\/_90440376_009891364-1.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    A Walkman (for those too young to remember)\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>So Nintendo certainly has an edge with its current success.<\/p><h2>A spike or a trend?<\/h2><p>The success of Pokemon Go is shared in part with the developers - Google spin-off Niantic - and we can expect to see similar games from other companies soon. <\/p><p>Yet Nintendo has a head start. \"The soaring stock price reflects the sentiment that Nintendo has hit upon a success case in mobile and augmented reality,\" David Corbin of industry website Tech in Asia told the BBC from Tokyo.<\/p><p>\"And it can be applied to other characters from its IP library - like Super Mario Brothers or Legend of Zelda.\"<\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Pokemon Go\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/90EA\/production\/_90389073_mediaitem90389069.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>EPA<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    Pokemon Go will launch in Japan on Friday\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Between 2006 and 2012, Nintendo profits soared on the back of its console success.

continued.<\/p><p>\"If you are a passenger, you are reading every day in the papers that it is more expensive to spend money on holiday,\" Ms McCall said, although she added that demand would probably \"normalise over next few months\".<\/p><p>Ms McCall also confirmed that the airline would not be following rivals such as Wizz Air in scaling back from the UK market as a result of

The appointment of private provider Circle Health to run Hinchingbrooke Hospital is the most famous - while the \u00a3800m UnitingCare contract to deliver healthcare for older people in Cambridgeshire was the biggest. Both of these fell apart - and a number of other projects collapsed or were abandoned at various stages.<\/p><p>On their website, the SPT says it \"supports projects which are often complex, hugely challenging and require a relentless work ethic\". <\/p><p>So have some of the projects have been too complex and challenging - or has the support not been good enough? NHS England are clear that they have \"real concerns\" about the work done.<\/p><p>The other big question is whether the demise of the SPT suggests the NHS in England is losing enthusiasm for big outsourcing projects like Hinchingbrooke and UnitingCare. <\/p><p>I'm told no ministers were involved in the decision to close the unit - so there hasn't been a change in government policy. But given the involvement of the SPT in so many of the biggest contracts - who inside the NHS now has the experience to carry on their work in the future?<\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Grey line\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/media\/images\/77207000\/jpg\/_77207535_464x2.jpg\" data-width=\"464\" data-height=\"2\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n        <\/figure><p>A senior manager inside one collapsed SPT project said his main issue had been \"their total refusal to acknowledge reality\".<\/p><p>They \"stuck doggedly to rules\" and a \"silly\" timetable, meaning \"honest discussions couldn't take place until too late\".<\/p><p>\"Any fool could've seen from the start that the competing regulatory requirements meant the project was doomed,\" he added.<\/p><p>\"Had the SPT been willing to listen we could've found a much better solution.\"<\/p><h2>'Catastrophic misunderstanding'<\/h2><p>Last week, an investigation into UnitingCare <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-cambridgeshire-36792483\">by the National Audit Office<\/a> (NAO) criticised the planning and lack of data setting out the true cost of the service.<\/p><p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.nao.org.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/07\/The-collapse-of-the-UnitingCare-Partnership-contract-in-Cambridgeshire-and-Peterborough.pdf\">report said<\/a> the SPT, which was paid \u00a3292,700, failed to include advice on the need to secure performance guarantees in the text of its evaluation of the contract.

But President Hollande said that on the key issues of access to the single market and free movement of people, the UK had to understand: you don't get one without the other. <\/p><hr><p>But Mr Hallande reaffirmed his support for France's Le Touquet border agreement with Britain, under which the UK operates immigration checkpoints in Calais and Dunkirk, while France has a checkpoint at Dover.<\/p><p>Mrs May said she understood the need for certainty and that was why she had said she did not intend to trigger article 50, the formal process of leaving the EU. this year.<\/p><p>She spoke briefly in French, stressing the deep friendship between the two countries, before going on to say she wanted to maintain \"the closest possible economic relationship\".<\/p><p>The prime minster said bilateral trade between the UK and France reached 50bn euros last year, each was the other's fifth largest export market, French companies employed 360,000 people across the UK while the UK was the fourth largest investor in France.<\/p><p>\"So as the UK leaves the EU we will have to determine how to maintain the closest possible economic relationship between our two countries - and it will take time to prepare for those negotiations.\"<\/p><h2>Nato obligations<\/h2><p>On the \"strategic defence partnership between our two countries\", she said, \"Britain brings a great deal to the table.\"<\/p><p>She stressed that France and the UK would continue to work together on issues such as counter-terrorism and defence and Britain would \"meet our Nato obligation to spend 2% of our GDP on defence and to keep our promise to spend 0.7% of our national income on aid\".<\/p><p>She added: \"As I have said Brexit means Brexit and I firmly believe we will make a success of it. Not just for the UK but for our European partners too. <\/p><p>\"We will continue to work together to keep our people safe and to stand up for our values around the world. We did so before the EU existed and we will continue to do so long after the UK has left.\"<\/p><p>It comes after she held talks about Brexit with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin.<\/p><p>Downing Street said the prime minister would stress that France was \"one of our oldest and most important partners, where the depth of our relationship - particularly on security and defence - is very important for both of us\".<\/p><p>BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said such encounters were currently at a \"getting to know you\" stage, with EU leaders waiting to see what the UK wants to achieve from the negotiations.<\/p><p>On Wednesday, at a joint press conference with Mrs Merkel, Mrs May said the UK was in no rush to trigger the two-year process of leaving the EU - telling reporters that although \"this would not please everyone\" it was right to hold off until the UK's \"objectives were clear\". <\/p><p>The German chancellor said the two countries had \"similar convictions and values\" and she was determined to proceed in the \"spirit of unity and friendship\" that characterised Anglo-German relations.<\/p>\n

President Erdogan radically enhanced powers for three months.<\/p><p>He and the cabinet will be able to enact laws bypassing parliament; the constitutional court will be unable to challenge them;

the daily life of citizens and that the state of emergency will only root out the \"virus\" behind the coup. It points out that similar measures are in France since the Paris attacks last November.

Donald Trump did that toward the end of the presidential primary campaign, questioning whether the elder Cruz had ties to John Kennedy's assassination. And on Wednesday night, before a national audience on the Republican Party's biggest stage, the Texas senator got his revenge. <\/p><p>As Mr Cruz left the stage after his non-endorsement speech, showered in boos, he gave a brief thumbs-up, apparently satisfied that the deed was done. And what he did was turn the Republican convention on its head once again. Now, everyone will be talking about his speech - overshadowing what should have been vice-presidential nominee Mike Pence's coming-out party. <\/p><p>Mr Pence is the stable, trusted conservative politician who was supposed to rally unsure Republicans behind their new standard-bearer. Instead, Mr Cruz revealed a party still sharply divided. While those inside the arena seemed united in booing the senator, some conservatives outside the Trump-friendly confines praised his actions.<\/p><p>Politically, Mr Cruz has made a risky move, however. He has staked his future presidential hopes on the chance that Republicans will view him as a principled conservative and not a right-wing Judas. Given that Donald Trump received more than 12 million votes in 2016, that is a lot of support that he may have just permanently angered. But an insult was answered. \"Lyin' Ted\" had his moment of vengeance. <\/p><hr><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"The Trump family reacts to Mr Cruz's speech\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/11D7E\/production\/_90468037_83f5eb57-d085-4aa3-bab3-b7b3d3459aab.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>AP<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    How the Trump family reacted to Mr Cruz's speech\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Mr Trump later said he knew Mr Cruz would not endorse him but had let him speak anyway.<\/p><p>New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said his actions were \"awful\" and New York Congressman Peter King called the speech \"disgraceful\".<\/p><p>Mr Cruz finished second to Mr Trump in the delegate count during the campaign.<\/p><hr><h2>Republican war of words<\/h2><p><strong>Trump on Cruz<\/strong><\/p><ul><li>\"I get along with everybody.
