The 5s is nearly three years old and Indian buyers, though price-conscious, have not shown much interest in buying old models.  <\/p><p>Apple, therefore, has a problem. Its newer models are expensive and its cheaper models are too old to be interesting for Indian buyers.<\/p><h2>Refurbished phones<\/h2><p>One answer is refurbished phones, which Apple sells in other markets. It calls them \"pre-owned and certified\", explaining that these are current models, often returned by a customer. These models go back to the factory to be tested and certified. They emerge with a new identity (an IMEI number) and warranty.<\/p><p>Analysts say this could be a winner for Apple because Indian buyers will be more willing to buy such phones at a discount.<\/p><p>Selling refurbished current models will increase Apple's share of the 15,000 to 30,000-rupee segment, which accounted for 5.6% of the smartphone market in the first quarter of 2016, according to CMR analyst Faisal Kawoosa. <\/p><p>\"With the brand equity of Apple, it can easily grab over 40% of this segment, almost doubling its sales,\" he says.<\/p><p>\"This could take Apple to selling four million units in 2016 in India.\"  <\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"An Indian woman talks on her mobile phone as she walks past the logo of the iPhone 4 during its launch by provider Aircel in Hyderabad on May 27, 2011.\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/776D\/production\/_89737503_50accb23-d0b7-41a3-8797-d63977393f52.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"600\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>Getty Images<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    Older iPhone models are cheaper, but their sale is low in India\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>There is a problem, though. <\/p><p>The government may not allow Apple to sell refurbished phones in India, citing concerns about \"dumping of old models\" and \"e-waste\". <\/p><p>Industry insiders say this appears to be a result of intense lobbying by rival handset vendors with the government to disallow Apple from selling refurbished phones.

Detaching easily from a surface was another challenge; if perching was the only goal, Mr Graule said, \"we could have put a little glue on top of the robot\".  <\/p><p>To solve these problems, the researchers designed a small, flat \"landing patch\" with an electrostatic charge that can be switched on and off. <\/p><p>When switched on, the patch acquires a negative charge that makes it stick to nearby, more positively charged surfaces.<\/p><p>You can experience a similar effect by \"rubbing a balloon on your hair then sticking it to a wall,\" explained principal investigator of the Harvard RoboBee project, Dr Robert Wood. And for the dismount, said Dr Wood, \"[we] simply remove power to the patch\". <\/p><p>What the team is most excited about though are the opportunities that such minuscule component parts promise for other applications.

We want our hands to be able to do more; that's why we have hammers. <\/p><p>VR allows us to go beyond the limitations of physical tools to do anything that can be computed. If you want to create a two-mile high tower made out of toothpicks, you can do it. <\/p><p>I did a series of 14 different environments; one where you felt like you were very high and had to look down: that was the first time people found this sense of vertigo within a virtual environment. I did a world where you look up towards the sky and see fireworks exploding; that's just magical. <\/p>                                                                                                    <p>I wanted to build a tool so people could use it. The best way to do that was to stay away from the consumer market because it really wasn't ready, and to go after industrial uses. <\/p><p>So my company created a viewing system that actually meets the specs of modern VR. <\/p><p>Because it had such high resolution, commercial users could use it to solve real problems. <\/p><p>Automobile companies used it for car design. Oil and gas industry used it to visualise data to figure out the right place to sink a well. <\/p><p>The next step was to make these cheap. Consumer VR up until then had a really narrow field of view; it was like looking through a tube of paper. Peripheral vision is really important for a visceral sense, and that's what people really react to. <\/p><p>To find a way to make it low cost and still retain that field of view, we harnessed the power of mobile phones - the screens, tracking and processing - and we figured out a lens design that was extremely inexpensive.<\/p><p>It's been really fun playing all these years, but there's something more important now, which is making it a space that allows us to harness our emotions, our desire to connect with people.<\/p><p>I'm worried by our current computer interfaces. I watch people walking around like zombies with cell phones in their hands, and I have to manoeuvre a mouse to fill out little boxes on web forms in a horribly frustrating way. I think VR will allow us to transcend this. <\/p><p>I don't worry so much about where VR is going, I worry about where we currently are.<\/p><hr><h2>Maria Korolov: Work, rest and play<\/h2><p><i>Maria Korolov is a technology journalist who has devoted her career to writing about virtual reality. <\/i><\/p><p>The biggest way [VR is changing the workplace] is training and simulations.

Google has been seeding elementary schools with over 100,000 virtual reality headsets and lesson plans. Kids are able to go on a virtual reality field trip to, say, the surface of the moon.<\/p><p>Gamers want something visceral. When you're riding a roller-coaster and you go down a hill, your stomach drops out: even though you know it's not real, your body reacts as if it's there. When I showed a shark simulation to people and they screamed, I laughed because, \"Ha ha, they're not real.\" Then I put it on and the shark came at me and I screamed, because it's a physical reaction. <\/p><p>The adult industry is jumping into this with everything they've got because it is so compelling. I have sampled it purely from a reviewer perspective, and it felt like you were in a locker room, and you don't know where to look because everyone's naked, and the lights are too bright, and they're interacting with you. This is going to be big. <\/p><p>The way the internet has changed the way we communicate information, virtual reality will change the way we communicate experiences. <\/p><p>If I wanted to show you what it's like to cook a meal, I could invite you to my virtual apartment and take you through a virtual cooking class. If I wanted to experience a walk in the woods with you, I could take you to my favourite virtual woods.<\/p><p>It will make the world even smaller than it is now.

I recently travelled to Iraq to interview former ISIS fighters \u2014people who just weeks ago had volunteered to be suicide bombers. <\/p><p>I learned that when aspiring fighters arrive at ISIS's headquarters in Raqqa, Syria, they are forced to give up two of their most prized possessions, their passport and their mobile phone \u2014 symbols of their physical and digital mobility.<\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"IS fighters in Raqqa in 2014\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/15824\/production\/_89700188_raqqa.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>AP<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    So-called Islamic State fighters have to give up their mobile phones in Raqqa\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The former fighters described life in the caliphate in stark contrast to the common ISIS narrative of a group of noble warriors fighting for Muslims' rights. The recruits couldn't speak freely, move freely, or use technology. <\/p><p>They were prisoners in every sense. Once the new joiners completed their six weeks of obligatory religious and military training, they got their phones back. <\/p><p>The defectors I spoke with were the lucky ones. They had contacts in a nearby military force who coordinated their escape. <\/p><p>Most people aren't so lucky. If my interviews are any indication, there are many young people who know immediately upon arrival in the caliphate that they have made a huge mistake and that they want to leave, but they don't know how. <\/p><p>They do, however, have access to a mobile phone and wi-fi. It would be a mistake not to exploit this opportunity to reach disaffected members of ISIS.<\/p><h2>'Fundamental right'<\/h2><p>Although these examples illustrate seemingly isolated cases of life under severe censorship or the deprivation of information, pro-democracy think tank Freedom House reports that, two thirds of the world faces some type of repression. <\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Computer keyboard\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/18380\/production\/_89700299_thinkstockphotos-489773763.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>Thinkstock<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    Some repressive governments are using the internet as a weapon\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>And more governments than ever are censoring information that is in the public's interest.<\/p><p>It's easy to take each of the above examples as isolated cases, or to make excuses for such oppression as the result of cultural differences.

In a report in February the committee, chaired by the former Labour Northern Ireland secretary Lord Murphy of Torfaen, called on the government to publish \"publish a fuller justification for each of the bulk powers\". <\/p><p>The committee highlighted three types of bulk powers in the bill for the security and intelligence agencies: the bulk interception of data, bulk acquisition of communications data and bulk interference with equipment.<\/p><p>The independent review will be established under David Anderson once he has selected two experts with security clearance to support him on technical and legal issues. He will report by the summer in time for the committee stage of the bill in the House of Lords.<\/p><h2>'Encouraging'<\/h2><p>Mr Burnham described the home secretary's letter as \"extremely encouraging\" but made clear the government needs to go further to win Labour support. The shadow home secretary was due to tell MPs in the commons debate on the Queen's speech: \"A few weeks ago, I wrote to the Home Secretary setting out seven areas where we want to see significant movement.<\/p><p>\"Yesterday the Home Secretary wrote to me on two of these issues and I have to say I found her letter extremely encouraging. <\/p><p>\"Her commitment to an independent review of the case for bulk powers is a major concession but the right thing to do and something which will build trust in this process.\"<\/p><p>Mr Burnham welcomed a second concession in the home secretary's letter - amending the bill to make clear that the security and intelligence agencies cannot use the powers to monitor legitimate trade union activity. The government believes that the agencies are not allowed to carry out such investigations.<\/p><p>But the home secretary is happy to amend the bill to reassure her Labour opposite number who supports the Shrewsbury 24 campaign which is pushing for the quashing of the convictions from the 1970s of construction worker pickets, including the actor Ricky Tomlinson.

it voted for Brexit. <\/p><p>However, it said this could be overshadowed by the negative impact on the UK economy, with a 0.6% fall in national income offsetting the benefits. <\/p><p>Mr Johnson said: \"Leaving the EU would give us an immediate \u00a38bn boost to the public finances, but the overwhelming consensus is that the economy would be smaller than otherwise following Brexit.<\/p><p>\"If the economy is just a few percentage points smaller than it otherwise would have been, we will be a bit worse off.\" <\/p><hr><h2>Analysis by Kamal Ahmed, BBC economics editor<\/h2><p>The IFS's report on the impact on the public finances of Brexit is different from the myriad of economic reports flowing from organisations as diverse as the International Monetary Fund and Economists for Brexit.<\/p><p>Rather than do its own economic modelling, the IFS has taken the mid-point of most of the major reports on the possible referendum impact and built its analysis from that.<\/p><p>It judges that mid-point to be closest to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research study which suggested that Brexit could leave the UK economy between 2% and 3.5% smaller than under a remain scenario.<\/p><p>From that the IFS uses a simple economic model that suggests that for every 1% decline in GDP, the government needs to raise an extra \u00a314bn due to lower tax receipts.<\/p><p>Of course, if the economic impact of Brexit is - in the long run - positive, as some economists argue, then the impact on the public finances would also be positive.<\/p><hr><p>The UK \"could perfectly reasonably decide that we are willing to pay a bit of a price for leaving the EU and regaining some sovereignty and control over immigration and so on\", Mr Johnson said. <\/p><p>\"That there would be some price though, I think is now almost beyond doubt.\"<\/p><p>But Vote Leave's John Redwood said the IFS was in the \"cosy establishment\" and the UK was better off out of the EU.<\/p><p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he disputed the forecasts used in the report, and said savings made from quitting the EU would mean austerity would not be needed.<\/p><p>But on Twitter Andrew Lilico, the chairman of Vote Leave-affiliated Economists for Britain, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/andrew_lilico\/status\/735363727415992321\">distanced himself from the criticisms of what he called the Leave campaign's \"propaganda arm\"<\/a>.<\/p><p>Patrick Minford, co-chairman of a separate group, Economists for Brexit, said that the IFS analysis acknowledged that the free trade approach recommended by his organisation \"would be the best option for the UK following an exit from the EU\".<\/p><p>Gerard Lyons, his co-chairman, added: \"The UK needs to break away from the short-termism and the groupthink that had dominated UK policy making and embrace Brexit as this is the best way to position the economy for longer-term future growth.\"<\/p><ul><li>\n<a

While many people remember 1967 for the \"Summer of Love\" and the way it embraced hippie looks, this is, again, targeting \"everywoman\", the people who worked in offices, shops and so on for whom patched jeans or a kaftan were dangerously subversive! But there is innovation going on here. Twiggy (left) was the model of the moment with a haircut and body shape that was very untraditional. It set a template for M&S's marketing of its products that was very directional, even if the fashion itself was mainstream.<\/p><h2>1972<\/h2><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Men's suit, Autumn Winter 1972\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/205E\/production\/_89768280_9.autumnwinter1972-menssuits.jpg\" data-width=\"624\" data-height=\"950\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>The Marks & Spencer Company Archive<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n        <\/figure><p>Given that this was the year of David Bowie, Glam Rock, Led Zeppelin and the like, this is very conservative up to a point and represents a certain kind of customer.

M&S has always been at the forefront of using new materials, and styles like this suit, shirt and tie would most likely have had easy-care features using advanced synthetic materials in conjunction with natural fibres.<\/p><h2>1983<\/h2><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Spring 1983 collection\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/476E\/production\/_89768281_spring1983.jpg\" data-width=\"624\" data-height=\"800\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>The Marks & Spencer Company Archive<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n        <\/figure><p>M&S was riding high in 1983 and while it was never a fashion beacon, it was still attracting a good cross-section of the population. This look is very mainstream - the Princess Diana-influenced flat shoes, the \"mini\" skirt that's not too short, the Dexy's Midnight Runners-style dungarees that by now had been around for a few years so no longer seemed unusual. This would have appealed to the woman in the street who wanted to tap into fashion trends very gently with clothes that she knew were good quality. <\/p>                                                                                                    <p>But it wouldn't really have appealed to fashion forward customers - they were too busy wearing Bodymap and Jean Paul Gaultier. Not that M&S couldn't have done high fashion. The chain had some superb designers at this time but its customer didn't want to be challenged, they wanted clothes that looked and felt good and that they knew would work for their lives.<\/p><h2>1996<\/h2><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Cardigan, January 1996\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/6E7E\/production\/_89768282_cardigan,jan1996.jpg\" data-width=\"624\" data-height=\"900\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>The Marks & Spencer Company Archive<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n        <\/figure><p>This was just a few years before M&S faced a perfect storm as fast fashion began to undermine its dominance. I think by the 90s it was quite complacent as it knew it had a devoted mainstream following who weren't about to defect to anything else on the High Street. This look sums that up. It's nice enough but given that a whole year earlier fashion had been shaken up by Tom Ford's 70s-influenced styling at Gucci and that Prada was starting to get into high gear, it's really very dull! <\/p><p>It's worth pointing out, though, that at the same time M&S was powering ahead in its food business and was innovating all over the place in terns of customer service, recipes and ingredients. That spirit of innovation didn't filter through to fashion, apart from in materials where it was an early user of innovative stretch fabrics. But that's because its typical customer at the time didn't want innovation. She might have wanted to experiment in the kitchen, but not with her wardrobe!<\/p><h2>2006<\/h2><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"(L-R) Erin O'Connor, Elizabeth Jagger and Laura Bailey pose for a photograph as they launch a new campaign for Marks and Spencer on September 12, 2006\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/BC9E\/production\/_89768284_gettyimages-71858839.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"700\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>Getty Images<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n        <\/figure><p>This was the height of M&S's obsession with celebrity models and the looks here reflect its fashion approach at the time.

It has to reach mainstream consumers. The recent Alexa Chung collection was an interesting one. Personally I wasn't overly-impressed, but the social media chatter around it was very positive and certain items seemed to sell out online very fast. While it was billed as being an \"archive\" collection, it was really a mix of straight replications and re-interpretations (like this dress that was based on a 1960s original). <\/p><p>I'm interested to see what they do with Alexa next. M&S really needs to turn its clothing offer around as it's so important to it. It may be doing well in foods but clothing is a higher-margin business so is crucial. It has a big challenge because its business model of a giant single-brand operation targeting so many different customers is one that struggles in the modern world where online stores, ultra-fast fashion and luxury are the headline-grabbers.<\/p><p><i>Sandra Halliday is a fashion expert and founder of the blog <\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/trendwalk.net\/\">trendwalk.net<\/a><\/p>\n                                                                                                <\/div>\n"},"Pisa tests for 21st Century 'global skills'":{"link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-36343602#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa","description":"The next Pisa tests will check 'global skills'","content":"<div property=\"articleBody\" contentScore=\"4755\">\n                                                                                                    <figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Global skills\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/9220\/production\/_89780473_global.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>Thinkstock<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    The next round of international Pisa tests will test the skills needed to live and work alongside people of different cultures\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p><strong>Pisa tests, an international standard for comparing education systems around the world, could include a new measurement of global skills in the next round of tests in 2018.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>The OECD, which runs the tests in maths, reading and science, is considering adding another test which would look at how well pupils can navigate an increasingly diverse world, with an awareness of different cultures and beliefs.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>The OECD's education director Andreas Schleicher explains why there is such a need for new rankings to show young people's competence in a world where globalisation is a powerful economic, political and cultural force.<\/strong><\/p><p>Education leaders around the world are increasingly talking about the need to teach \"global competences\" as a way of addressing the challenges of globalisation.<\/p><p>It was one of the key topics at this month's meeting of education ministers from the G7 group of leading industrial countries, held in Japan.<\/p><div id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n    <div>\n        \n    <\/div>\n<\/div><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"digital economy\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/113C4\/production\/_89769507_032961862.jpg\" data-width=\"624\" data-height=\"351\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>Reuters<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    The digital economy will need workers who can work in different cultures\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Globalisation can mean different things to different people.

How can receiving countries integrate diverse groups of people and avoid rising extremism and fundamentalism?<\/li>\n<li>Sustainability: Delivering on the UN Sustainable Development Goals is a priority in the international community. Development that meets the needs of the present, without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, is more relevant than ever before, in the face of environmental degradation, climate change, overconsumption and population growth.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Today, all three principles are at risk.

But if you're paying for a \"vice product\" like cookies, cakes and pies you are acting on a visceral impulse. <\/p><p>The pain of paying can't be justified so easily. So if you're using a plastic card you can mitigate that pain and you're more likely to go ahead and buy.<\/p><p>Interestingly the researchers also found that \"tightwads\" who are generally reluctant to spend, were more susceptible to the soothing influence of paying with a card, compared to the \"spendthrifts\" who part with money more easily in the first place. <\/p><p>Given that most of us, when faced with a doughnut, can experience difficulties with \"impulse control\" this information could prove useful.<\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Jean-Robert Kamdoum\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/61C3\/production\/_89772052_20160523_091131-1.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    When he ran a test, Jean-Robert Kamdoum found paying with contactless made him spend more than usual\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Steve Peters is author of The Chimp Paradox, a book examining how our rational, long-term decision-making tries to constrain our desire for immediate gratification.<\/p><p>\"One of the systems works very impulsively. By nature the contactless payments favours that system. Whereas the cash in your hand makes you act rationally. It favours the system where you're going to think through the consequences of your action.\" <\/p><p>So could contactless payments - waving a card or a phone briefly over a reader - further weaken our ability to resist the treats?<\/p><p>Claudia Hammond, author of a new book, Mind over Money, and a presenter on BBC radio, says it's too soon to judge the impact of contactless per se, but she believes it's likely to follow a similar pattern.<\/p><p>\"I think there is something that feels even more unreal about contactless payment,\" she says.<\/p><p>\"No-one has measured that yet, but I would say it will divorce the pain of paying from the actual transaction again.\" <\/p><p>So it could well make people spend more, not just on food but on all sorts of things.<\/p><p>\"People don't remember how much they paid when it's on a card.

of the warnings they receive than is necessary, the research suggests.<\/p><p>It said: \"Whilst some children needed to be protected, there is little evidence to support this scale of statutory

father was yelling at his children and might be taking drugs.<\/p><p>\"Many of these lead to nothing,\" he said.<\/p><p>\"We have this mantra that says it's everybody's job to safeguard children but what we are doing doesn't actually safeguard children. <\/p><p>\"Creating these huge numbers of referrals of concern is like creating a huge, extra big haystack in which we are trying to find the

still feel that you are under threat.\"<\/p><p>A Department for Education spokesperson said: \"Ensuring children are safe and well looked after is our top priority - where there are concerns about a

institutions, more than nine out of 10 report that a no to low impact is anticipated,\" said the spokesman. <\/p><p>\"We would like to see the UCU consulting its members on the final offer.\"<\/p><p>The employers say the offer is \"at, and, for some, beyond, a limit of affordability for higher education institutions and the very best offer that will be available this year\". <\/p><p>They maintain the weighting of the offer means the worst paid university staff will get a rise of more than 5%. <\/p><p>They say they have also offered talks on zero-hours contracts and on improving lower pay for female academics.  <\/p><h2>Autumn term<\/h2><p>But UCU says it rejected the 1.1% offer as it was only a marginal improvement on the original 1% on which it had balloted

correspondent<\/strong><\/p><p>Insiders have been telling me that while improvements have been made to Birmingham children's services, the department still struggles to retain staff and therefore relies heavily on agency workers. <\/p><p>They also say that social workers can still be dealing with between 20 and 30 individual cases, even though a maximum of 15 is recommended. <\/p><p>Critics of the council have been calling for a change along these lines for years, but it's unlikely that the new voluntary trust, however it is set up, will be a panacea for the city's problems. <\/p><p>Birmingham's central belt is one of the most deprived areas in the country and the city's population is rapidly growing. <\/p><p>Whoever takes charge will have to address recruitment and morale as a matter of urgency. <\/p><hr><p>Professor Ray Jones, who has advised councils on social services, said if there was \"a lot of work to do and not enough people to do the work, that'll be the same in the trust as anywhere else\". <\/p><p>An NSPCC spokesman said: \"Concerted efforts must now be made to improve staff retention rates and - most importantly of all - ensure the most vulnerable members of society are protected.\"<\/p><p>Brigid Jones, cabinet member for Children's Services at the city council, said it was \"a voluntary move\", adding: \"We will retain control of design, delivery, and the trust itself\".<\/p><p>\"Our caseloads are the lowest that they've been: they're 15 now on average, they were around 30 on average when I started,\" said Ms Jones.<\/p><p>\"We've got our staff turnover down from around a third to around a quarter. And the number of agency social workers has come down significantly as well. <\/p><p>\"What we need to do now is find a way to keep that improvement going. And we think that by going into some sort of trust arrangement, we can do that in the best way.\"<\/p><p>Alison Holt, BBC social affairs correspondent, said the announcement was brought forward because of a Channel 4 Dispatches programme to be broadcast this week.<\/p><p>She said: \"Similar children's trusts have been established to run services in places where there have been problems such as Doncaster and Slough.<\/p><p>\"They often rely on groups of experts, charities and high-performing local authorities to provide support.\"<\/p><p>Perry Barr MP, Khalid Mahmood, said he welcomed the news that a trust would make key decisions, but said there were still \"huge issues\" around how it would be staffed, managed and resourced.<\/p><hr><h2>Undercover TV investigation<\/h2><ul><li>A spokeswoman from Dispatches said its undercover investigation revealed a \"troubling picture of chaos, low staff morale, confused decision-making and overstretched colleagues struggling to cope\"<\/li>\n<li>Key findings included concern over cases \"where children could be at risk of sexual or physical abuse are not being handled properly\" and social workers \"not receiving appropriate supervision\" and wanting to quit<\/li>\n<li>One junior social worker resigned after \"being forced to 'beg' for help from managers\"<\/li>\n<li>There was confusion over how cases should be categorised.

procedures to protect these children from criminalisation. <\/p><p>Lord Laming's report says half of children in custody in England and Wales have, at some time, been in care.<\/p><p>The government said the safety and well-being of children was \"paramount\".<\/p><p>The report, In Care, Out of Trouble, describes how looked-after children are often prosecuted for challenging behaviour that would normally be dealt with in the family home.<\/p><div id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n    <div>\n        \n    <\/div>\n<\/div><h2>'Kicking doors'<\/h2><p>A recently retired magistrate gave examples to the review of young people appearing in court for \"kicking doors, squirting shower gel on carpets, or using abusive language to staff\".<\/p><p>She said she \"often raised concerns about the way trivial incidents in children's homes resulted in police call-outs and prosecutions in circumstances where ordinary parents would never resort to criminalising their own children\".<\/p><p>Even though the Crown Prosecution Service and the local authority reassured her that all cases were reviewed according to special protocols designed to weed out minor misdemeanours, the children kept on appearing, she said.<\/p>                                                                                                    <p>The report says: \"This is a national problem which central and local government, and local criminal justice agencies, can and must do more to address.<\/p><p>\"Reductions in the rate at which children in care are criminalised will not happen by accident.\"<\/p><p>A government spokesman said: \"The rules are clear that no child living in a children's home should be criminalised for behaviour that would not concern the police if it happened in a family home.<\/p><p> \"While youth crime is down, we recognise that reoffending rates are too high and that the care and supervision of young offenders in custody is not good enough.\"<\/p><h2>Criminal record<\/h2><p>The spokesman added that a review had been ordered into the youth justice system and was due to come back in the summer with recommendations for improvements in care.<\/p><p>The report comes a week after David Cameron pledged that those leaving care would be given \"far more effective support\", with the introduction of a care leavers' covenant.<\/p><p>It calls for the charge to be taken forward at the very highest level, with the Cabinet forming a sub-committee charged with protecting children and young people in care from criminalisation.<\/p><p>The committee should then draw up cross-departmental agreements, which would require local authorities, police and other agencies to set targets locally to reduce the prosecution of these vulnerable and often traumatised youngsters.<\/p><p>Low-level criminal behaviour should not be recorded as a crime but should instead lead to a referral to a welfare agency, the report says.<\/p><p>Lord Laming said: \"As soon as the police are called, it's a criminal record. It's all part of the criminalisation of them.<\/p><p>\"We don't need to do that - it's quite avoidable but to avoid it we need leadership, imagination, direction and determination.\"<\/p><p>Lord Laming also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that some teenagers did \"dreadful things\" and, in such cases, should be dealt with by the justice system.<\/p><p>\"But that is altogether different from the police being called in circumstances that in a normal family, they would be dealt with within the family.\" <\/p><h2>Information sharing<\/h2><p>The report acknowledges there is already

evacuated as a precaution, meaning some GCSE, A-level and Higher exams had to be abandoned.<\/p><p>The BBC News website answers some of the key questions on the issue.<\/p><h2>Is there any bomb alert guidance for schools?<\/h2><p>Yes. There is a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jcq.org.uk\/exams-office\/ice---instructions-for-conducting-examinations\/instructions-for-conducting-examinations-2015-2016\">procedure for schools<\/a> to follow in the event of an emergency such as a fire or bomb alert during public examinations. <\/p><p>This is set out by the Joint Council for Qualifications, which represent the seven largest UK exam providers.<\/p><div id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n    <div>\n        \n    <\/div>\n<\/div><h2>What should schools do then?<\/h2><p>Exam invigilators are advised to stop candidates from writing, collect the attendance register (in order to ensure all candidates are present) and evacuate the examination room.<\/p><p>Students should be told to leave all question papers and scripts in the exam room and must leave the exam hall in silence.<\/p><p>Staff must make sure that the candidates are supervised as closely as possible while they are out of the exam hall, to make sure there is no discussion about the examination.<\/p>                                                                                                    <p>Invigilators should make a note of the time of the interruption and how long it lasted and allow the candidates the full working time set for the examination.<\/p><p>The guidance says if there are only a few candidates, schools should consider the possibility of taking the candidates (with question papers and scripts) to another place to finish the examination.<\/p><p>Schools have to make a full report of the incident and of the action taken and send this to the relevant exam board.<\/p><h2>What about students' results?<\/h2><p>Students whose public exams were disrupted can rest assured that the situation will be fed back to the examiners. Schools will document how the exams were affected and send this to the exam boards. The boards will make any adjustments as they see fit, on a case-by-case basis.<\/p><p>A spokeswoman for the AQA exam board said: \"We need to look at each case on an individual basis because there are a range of ways in which students might have been affected - they might have taken all, part or none of the exam, or been affected by the incident in different ways. <\/p><p>\"Once we know the full circumstances from the schools, we can decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, our message to students is not to worry and to concentrate on the exams they've got coming up.\" <\/p><h2>What happened in schools following Monday's calls?<\/h2><p>It is not yet clear exactly how many schools received a hoax call and how each individual school dealt with it. It is thought some schools dismissed the caller as a hoax, while others implemented an evacuation.<\/p><p>For approximately 240 GCSE and A-level candidates at Canterbury Academy in Kent, the hoax call meant their exams had to be interrupted.<\/p><p>Head teacher Phil Karnavas said  a thorough police search of his large school took three and a half hours to complete, meaning the exams could not be resumed.  <\/p><p>Mr Karnavas said students, who were sitting a mixture of GCSE English, A-level English, A-level product design and A-level textiles, would not have the option to re-sit the disrupted exams.<\/p><p>He told the BBC: \"What will happen now is is the work they managed to complete in the exam will be taken into account, as will other parts of their examination - other papers - and if there was any controlled assessment or coursework, that will be taken into account.  <\/p><p>\"Special consideration will be launched and an aggregate grade will be awarded.\"<\/p><h2>What is special consideration?<\/h2><p>Special consideration is a post-exam adjustment to a candidate's mark or grade on the part of exam boards.<\/p><p>It is used to in circumstances where temporary illness, temporary injury or other indisposition at the time of the exam, could have had an effect on a candidate's ability to take an exam or demonstrate his or her normal level of attainment.<\/p><p>Schools which were evacuated mid-way through exams on Monday would have grounds to apply for special consideration for their students.<\/p><h2>What are the police doing about these incidents? <\/h2><p>The police are currently investigating the spate of hoax calls to UK schools on Monday.<\/p><p>Officers say there is no information at this stage to suggest the incidents are terrorist-related, however enquiries are continuing to establish the facts. <\/p><p>A spokeswoman for the  National Police Chiefs' Council  said: \"Forces are working together to investigate who is responsible and whether incidents are linked.  At this point, there is nothing to link these with a spate of similar calls earlier this year but this has not been ruled out.  <\/p><p>\"Police take hoaxes extremely seriously. They divert police resources and cause disruption and alarm to the public.\"<\/p><h2>What should pupils and parents do?<\/h2><p>The best thing pupils and parents can do is to stay calm and try not to let the incident distract them from the rest of the exams.<\/p><p>If they have any concerns, they should raise them with senior staff at the school.<\/p><h2>What does the government say?<\/h2><p>The Department for Education, which oversees schools in England, says in the event of a call like those on Monday, schools should - where possible - seek alternative venues for students to sit their exams.<\/p><p>It says staff should alert the exam boards as soon as possible and also make sure pupils and their parents are kept updated.<\/p><h2>I may have some information relating to these hoaxes.

guidance which tightened up the regulations in 2013, limiting head teachers on whether they could authorise holiday in term-time and opening the way to the mass fining of parents. <\/p><p>The Jon

They beat St John's College, Oxford, by 215 points to 30.<\/p><p>And yet there's no set route to appearing on the programme. A spokeswoman for ITV Studios, which produces it for BBC Two, says each university has its own team selection process. <\/p><p>Some of these are much more rigorous than others. Many student union presidents \"pick themselves and three of their mates\", <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blanchflower.org\/uc\/faq_applying.html\">writes<\/a> Sean Blanchflower, who won the competition in 1995 as part of the Trinity College, Cambridge, team.<\/p><p>Others organise some kind of selection quiz. The journalist Flora Watkins, who represented Edinburgh University in 1999, didn't face much competition when she arrived at the appointed time. \"There may only have been the four of us who ended up on the programme,\" she recalls.<\/p><div id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n    <div>\n        \n    <\/div>\n<\/div><p>But elsewhere it's far more competitive. Manchester University - whose four titles make it the joint highest series winners along with Magdalen College, Oxford - has a famously rigorous recruitment process managed by Stephen Pearson, a member of the library staff <a href=\"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/culture\/tvandradio\/10020736\/Alex-Ferguson-of-University-Challenge-lives-for-the-buzz.html\">nicknamed<\/a> \"the Alex Ferguson of University Challenge\".<\/p><p>Pearson sets the approximately 150 students who apply to represent Manchester each year a 100-question general knowledge written test.

Contestants have to achieve a baseline mark in a test paper set by producers (filling it in, Watkins' strategy was that \"the answer to any given question would be either Churchill or Beethoven\") and demonstrate a solid level of knowledge in an interview session. <\/p><p>Before going on air, it's advisable to start practising buzzer technique. Watkins says she bitterly regrets not having done this, as her side was knocked out by a Peterhouse team with sharper reaction times. In the run-up to the Manchester team's trip to the studios, Pearson organises weekly \"friendly\" quizzes for his charges against alumni of the programme.<\/p><p>There are different views on how best to prepare on the day. Former Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind has attributed his Edinburgh side's first-round victory to how \"relaxed\" they became in the pub beforehand. Novelist Sebastian Faulks, however, who drank three bottles of barley wine before appearing on the quiz and smoked Players Number 6 throughout, was less enamoured of the experience. \"When my parents watched the programme, they were appalled\", he <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/tvshowbiz\/article-1101701\/Fingers-Buzzers-As-BBC2-devotes-night-homage-University-Challenge-eccentric-quiz-addictive.html#ixzz46Gu9a9bP\">remembered<\/a>.<\/p><p>Perhaps the most controversial aspect of the selection process is the fact that Oxford and Cambridge enter individual colleges to the contest, while other institutions compete on a university-wide basis. In 1975 the Manchester team (which included the future Times columnist David Aaronovitch) protested against this state of affairs by answering \"Trotsky\", \"Lenin\", \"Karl Marx\" or \"Che Guevara\" to every question.<\/p><p>It's a point of contention whether this helps or impedes Oxbridge. Critics say it gives each student at the elite institutions a better chance of getting on the show.

If someone back then had advised me of the actual facts, I probably would have turned up to at least one.\" <\/p><p>The band's refusal to play the industry game meant they could focus on making music. They released five albums in six years, with singles Dreaming Of You, Pass It On and In The Morning becoming major hits.<\/p><p>\"We were discouraged from releasing that many albums,\" says Power. \"We wanted to do more. Major labels don't want you to do that.\"<\/p><p>In fact, they have hours of unreleased material - Power mentions \"a concept album about an otter recorded in a \u00a31,500-a-day studio\" - but after 2010's Butterfly House, their first album without guitarist Bill Ryder-Jones, they were \"bereft of ideas\".<\/p><h2>Streaming boost<\/h2><p>They announced an indefinite hiatus, during which Power released two books of poetry; while Skelly recorded a solo album and started producing other bands, including BBC Sound of 2016 finalists Blossoms.<\/p><p>More importantly, Skelly dug out the sessions of a \"lost\" Coral album - 2006's The Curse Of Love - and polished them off for a full release. <\/p><p>\"It had no promotion at all,\" says Power, \"but the reaction was so good\" it became the catalyst for the band's revival.<\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"The Coral\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/1E1C\/production\/_89780770_5dce2da3-8b2f-4db4-b82b-410119079280.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    James Skelly: \"It's not a nostalgia thing.

Once we'd released it, I wrote the whole new album.\"<\/p><p>Distance Inbetween is inspired by the graphic novels of Alan Moore, the photography of Gregory Crewdson and even box set behemoth Mad Men - all of which expose the horror lurking beneath the \"normality\" of suburbia.<\/p><p>\"It's all churches and old people's homes around here,\" says Power. \"The image of something horrific or supernatural within that landscape is one of the things I find most powerful.\"<\/p><p>The album has seen The Coral's reputation restored, not to mention their confidence.<\/p><p>\"We're much more certain and much more focused now,\" says Power. \"In the middle period, we were really unsure with what we were doing. Being best mates was the only thing that bound us together. Morseo, it helped us survive.\"<\/p><p>Distance Inbetween became the band's eighth album to reach the top 20 in March. It even topped the vinyl charts, much to the band's delight.<\/p><p>\"I think it says something about the audience that they're willing to get behind us, and they genuinely care about the band,\" says Power. \"They enjoy the artwork and how we present it as a full thing.\"<\/p><p>But the band don't want to be seen as relics, constantly harking back to a \"golden era\" when fans actually bought records.<\/p><p>\"I don't mind what way people listen to music,\" protests Skelly. \"For kids now, streaming is the way they listen to music.

Yet dance had more or less disappeared and Warchus was keen to revive the tradition.  <\/p>                                                                                                    <p>McOnie says he's been waiting since childhood for someone to make the kind of offer the Old Vic has made.   <\/p><p>\"Slightly naively I said to Matthew I would come up with three titles we could choose from.  But after I went home I found myself thinking more and more about Jekyll & Hyde as an option.  It's about physical transformation so I thought it could work well for dance.<\/p><p>\"But initially I told myself no it just won't work.  Obviously when Stevenson wrote the book in the Victorian era no one knew the twist - that Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde turn out to be two sides of the same man.  But that big reveal is lost to us - all the films and the spoofs mean audiences know what's coming.<\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Tim Hodges in Jekyll & Hyde\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/11786\/production\/_89785517_20709cf5-c13e-48ab-87e6-74ca9cb3823e.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"600\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>Manuel Harlan <\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    Tim Hodges, who plays Mr Hyde, says the audience needs to ask: 'When you see blood on a character is that real blood or just something Hyde sees in his mind's eye?'\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>\"But somehow thinking about how impossible it all was made it more tempting.  When I came back to Matthew it was the only idea I offered and fortunately he said yes.\"<\/p><p>The Old Vic's current interior dates from the 1870s so it might appear the perfect home for a classic Victorian tale. McOnie struggled with that as a plan but finally dropped it.  <\/p><p>\"I just couldn't find a voice for the Victorian age which interested me so the show is loosely set in the 1950s.  It was a decade when there was a lot of pretence, which is perfect.  Also I knew that part of the show's aesthetic was going to echo all those brilliant old MGM musicals with Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly which I love.\"<\/p><p>Grant Olding's score divides into two.  The dance numbers for Jekyll and his romantic interest Dahlia feel like something Harold Arlen or Jule Styne might have written 60 years ago - McOnie says they're a bit like songs without lyrics. <\/p><p>\"But for Hyde's big dance numbers there's a more contemporary feel - a bluesy White Stripes sort of sound.  I think the contrast works well as the story gets darker.\"<\/p><p>Collins and Hodges have talked a lot about the relationship and the differences between their characters.  Hodges says audiences have to make basic decisions about what the story actually is. <\/p><p>\"For me the American Psycho parallel is pretty important.  Are the dark things which my character Hyde does - and the show does get pretty gory - really just fantasy?  When you see blood on a character is that real blood or just something Hyde sees in his mind's eye?  I'm not sure we ever offer the audience easy answers.\"<\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Jekyll & Hyde\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/13964\/production\/_89782208_danielcollins-drjekyllandrachelmuldoon-dahlia,jekyll-hydeattheoldvic.photobymanuelharlan-3.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>Manuel Harlan <\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    Choreographer Drew McOnie says he has become 'really involved' with his show\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Collins says the relationship makes him think of Tyler Durden in Fight Club.  \"So when my character has spent time as Hyde it's like when you've had a really massive night out and you're not really sure what's gone on.\"<\/p><p>Hodges says another influence has been thinking about the TV series Dexter. \"There you've got a central character who does awful things yet the audience has to feel sympathy for him. <\/p><p>\"But in our show it's complex because they're two separate characters.  Though that brings you back to the big question - are they two people or one man with a wild and dangerous imagination?\"<\/p><p> Hodges became a father at the weekend so he missed the first two performances.  <\/p><p>\"It's a show you get really involved with so - despite the lack of sleep - I'm relishing the rest of the run.  <\/p><p>\"The rhythms of the evening are different for me and Danny: I have fewer scenes but they get very intense as the violence kicks in.

In November he'll direct and choreograph a stage version of the film Strictly Ballroom at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds.<\/p><p>\"But for now I'm concentrating on Jekyll & Hyde.

GPs have been paid to reduce their use of antibiotics. <\/p><p>Local health bosses were given extra money by NHS England to get prescribing down and they have used this to incentivise doctors. Different arrangements were made in different areas, but some GP practices received in excess of \u00a320,000 for hitting the targets. Next year the targets have been extended to 4% for overall use and 20% for broad spectrum antibiotics. <\/p><p>In the NHS money, it seems, talks - but if it helps tackle what experts have described as a \"greater threat than cancer\" nobody will be complaining.  <\/p><hr><p>Reducing unnecessary prescribing saves the NHS money in drug costs.<\/p><p>The figures show GPs have overshot the targets.

years ago, was said to have approved of the plan.<\/p><p>The mother lost a High Court case last year but was subsequently granted permission to challenge the decision.<\/p><p>The latest round of the case is being heard at the Court of Appeal in London, before a panel of three judges. <\/p><div id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n    <div>\n        \n    <\/div>\n<\/div><h2>'Natural sympathy'<\/h2><p>The UK fertility regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), said, in 2014, the daughter's eggs could not be released from storage in London because she had not given her full written consent before she had died, from bowel cancer at the age of 28. <\/p><p>But, in the latest legal proceedings, lawyers acting for the mother told the judges she wanted to fulfil her daughter's wishes to carry a child created from her frozen eggs and \"raise that child\".<\/p><p>Jenni Richards QC added the eggs would \"simply be allowed to perish\" if the court did not rule in her favour. <\/p>                                                                                                    <p>Meanwhile, Catherine Callaghan, appearing for the HFEA, said in a written argument before the court: \"It is natural to feel sympathy for the appellants' loss and for their wish to keep their daughter's memory alive by trying to conceive a child using their daughter's eggs.\"<\/p><p>But it was not the court's role to decide whether it would have permitted the mother to undergo fertility treatment using her daughter's eggs. <\/p><p>Ms Callaghan added: \"Rather its role is to determine whether Mr Justice Ouseley erred in concluding that the HFEA's statutory approvals committee acted lawfully and rationally in exercising its broad discretion to refuse to authorise export of the frozen eggs to a treatment centre in New York for use in the way proposed.\" <\/p><h2>'Required consent'<\/h2><p>During earlier High Court proceedings in June 2015, the court was told her daughter was desperate to have children and had asked her mother to \"carry my babies\".<\/p><p>Lawyers acting for the mother and her 59-year-old husband told Mr Justice Ouseley the daughter would have been \"devastated\" if she had known her eggs could not be used.<\/p><p>But the judge ruled that the HFEA was entitled to find the daughter had not given \"the required consent\" and said there had been no breach of the family's human rights.<\/p><p>Although she consented for her eggs to be stored for use after her death, she did not fill in a separate form outlining how she wished them to be used. <\/p><p>He said he was dismissing the case \"conscious of the additional distress which this will bring to the claimants, whose aim has been to honour their daughter's dying wish\".<\/p><p>It was thought if the case had been successful her mother could have become the first person in the world to become pregnant using a dead daughter's eggs.<\/p><p>In February 2016, when seeking permission to appeal, her lawyers argued there was \"clear evidence\" of what the daughter wanted to happen to her eggs when she died.  <\/p><h2>'Prospect of success'<\/h2><p>Lord Justice Treacy said the case papers had left him doubtful as to whether there would be \"sufficiently strong\" reasons to allow the challenge to continue further. <\/p><p>But after hearing submissions in court, he concluded there was \"an arguable case with a real prospect of success\".<\/p>\n

This abnormal release leads can cause weight loss by making the body break down proteins and fat.<\/p><p>High energy foods can help people to maintain their weight, but Dr Shaw notes that it is sometimes hard to know what to eat. <\/p><p>Many of her patients eat a lot of soup. <\/p><p>\"It's liquid, it goes down easily, it's a prime choice. But, as a dietician, I will often talk to them about the fact that soup is often low in energy, and it's often low in protein. <\/p><p>\"So people might be using it as a replacement for a meal, but it's not providing the same nourishment as a meal.' <\/p><p>Other high energy meals such as roasted chicken, or more nutritious soups, are advised. <\/p><h2>Soft is best<\/h2><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Ginger\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/media\/images\/81449000\/jpg\/_81449998_ginger.jpg\" data-width=\"624\" data-height=\"351\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    Ginger is often recommended for patients - but doesn't suit all\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>People being treated for cancer often find it difficult to eat due to a sore or dry mouth or throat and difficulty swallowing whilst undergoing treatment<\/p><p>That's because the digestive system is lined with a soft layer of tissue called the mucous membrane.

It says people can be driven to doing it because they think the physical symptoms of self-poisoning and other types of self-injury, such as cutting themselves, will be easier to cope with than their emotional pain. <\/p><p>But charities say self harm doesn't actually alleviate suffering, and although self-poisoners don't want to kill themselves, they put themselves at risk of serious injury and death. <\/p><hr><h2>What is self-poisoning?<\/h2><ul><li>It is a type of self-harm, normally triggered by anxiety or depression<\/li>\n<li>Doctors say people tend to cut themselves as a way of trying to cope with difficulty in their lives, while self-poisoning can happen to those who feel they can no longer cope<\/li>\n<li>If someone deliberately poisons themselves, it does not always mean they are trying to end their life<\/li>\n<\/ul><hr><p>Ashton, who is 20 years old, says she gets the urge to self-injure three or four times a week.

It's a lot easier to describe your symptoms when you feel physically sick - you don't have to explain them to people in the same way as feeling bad emotionally.

I began to realise that learning to love myself again was really important.\"<\/p><p>Sarah, who has scars from cutting herself and suffered some liver damage from self-poisoning, also took up yoga. \"I needed to learn to love my body, as well as my mind and yoga helped me with that,\" she says. \"Aspects like learning how to breathe better helped me to relax.\"<\/p><p>In February Sarah celebrated a full year without self-poisoning. She continues to practise yoga and hopes, in the future, to speak to teenagers about how they can also overcome it. \"It's not easy,\" she says, \"but it can be done.\"<\/p><hr><p>If you have concerns about the issues dealt with in this article, these organisations offer advice and information:<\/p><p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lifesigns.org.uk\/\">Life Signs<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.harmless.org.uk\/\">Harmless<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youngminds.org.uk\/\">Young Minds<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mind.org.uk\/\">Mind<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.samaritans.org\/\">Samaritans<\/a><\/p><hr><p><i>Black and white photographs by Phil Coomes<\/i><\/p><p><i>Subscribe to the <\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/ssl.bbc.co.uk\/newsletters\/newsmagazine?ptrt=http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/magazine\">BBC News Magazine's email newsletter<\/a><i> to get articles sent to your inbox.<\/i><\/p>\n                                                                                                <\/div>\n"},"Are there still taboos around childbirth?":{"link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/health-36229822#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa","description":"Are there still taboos surrounding childbirth?","content":"<div property=\"articleBody\" contentScore=\"4215\">\n                                                                                                    <figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Newborn baby\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/179DF\/production\/_89653769_newborn.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>Thinkstock<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n        <\/figure><p>Many mothers' birth plans end up in the bin, with their baby born via an emergency Caesarean or with labour induced.

Surely in 21st Century Britain we should, by now, understand as much about the organs that start life as much as those that support it.<\/p><p>One thing is very clear - this lack of research funding cannot be explained by a lack of need. <\/p><p>Across England and Wale more than 55,000 babies were born too early in 2014.  Preterm birth is common, affecting about 8% of pregnancies and is the leading cause of death in newborn babies, as well as increasing the likelihood of serious long-term health problems to surviving babies. <\/p><p>Yet we are largely in the dark about preventing it.  <\/p><h2>Real risk<\/h2><p>Over 100,000 women will have births that need medical or surgical intervention. <\/p><p>The leading cause of emergency C-sections is that the muscle of the uterus gets tired - this is dangerous because without the muscle contracting, the baby cannot be delivered through the birth canal. <\/p><p>There is just one drug, which was introduced 50 years ago, that can be offered to help women suffering these labours, which are termed \"failure to progress\". And that one drug works only half the time.  <\/p><p>We can neither predict which women will have these difficult labours, nor which will not respond to the drug, and need surgery. <\/p><p>Such labours are common, affecting one in 10 births and can be enormously traumatic for the women involved. <\/p><p>Many often decide against subsequent children or elect to have a C-section, with its small but nevertheless real risk. <\/p><p>Only awareness and more funding for research in these areas can start to make these stark figures better, and make women's birth plans less of a wish list.  <\/p><p>Mothers will have choice only when we improve the scientific base to understand difficult pregnancies and births, and increase the chances of them being able to have the healthy birth they want for their baby.<\/p>\n                                                                                                <\/div>\n"},"'My brother was let down badly'":{"link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/health-36330257#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa","description":"My brother's brain injury was ignored because of dementia","content":"<div property=\"articleBody\" contentScore=\"6095\">\n                                                                                                    <figure><span>\n                \n                <img alt=\"Philip Blewett next to a hot air balloon\" src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/17B3B\/production\/_89738079_tew01004215_00386.jpg\" width=\"976\" height=\"549\"><span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>George and Lilian Blewett<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    Before the accident, Philip was an active person, living independently and enjoying life, his family says\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The family of a man with mild dementia who was seriously injured in a road traffic accident says people living with the condition are being let down badly and not given the urgent medical care they need.<\/p><p>Philip Blewett was diagnosed with early Alzheimer's disease in 2013 at the age of 64. <\/p><p>George, his older brother, says he was living a very full life - \"you would hardly have known about the diagnosis\".<\/p><p>Philip was living on his own, happily managing his own affairs.

also called for the Barnett Formula to be scrapped.<\/p><p>The formula, which is used to distribute funds across the different parts of the UK, should be replaced by a new needs-based system, their

\"inattentive approach to the integrity of the Union cannot continue\", with the Lords calling for any further plans to transfer power out of Westminster to be \"considered within an appropriate framework of constitutional principles that safeguard the integrity of the Union\".<\/p><p>In future, a \"Devolution Impact Assessment\" could be published, examining the potential impact of proposals on the \"cohesiveness and stability of the Union as a whole, and on each of its constituent nations\".<\/p>                                                                                                    <p>Ministers have also been urged to adopt a new approach to devolution, with the report saying: \"A new mindset is required at all levels of government - one that recognises the devolved institutions as now being established components of the UK's constitution.<\/p><p>\"This new mindset will require abandoning a 'devolve and forget' attitude.<\/p><p>\"Instead, the UK government should engage with the devolved institutions across the whole breadth of government policy, co-operating and collaborating where possible. <\/p><p>\"In particular, the Joint Ministerial Committee should be reformed to promote co-operation and collaboration, rather than grandstanding and gesture politics.\"<\/p><h2>'Group of cronies'<\/h2><p>The report also said it was \"too soon to know\" whether English Votes for English Laws (Evel) and \"devolution deals\" - where local authorities are given greater power - would provide an answer to the \"English question\", which has left the largest part of the UK as the only part without its own assembly.<\/p><p>Responding to the report, SNP MP Pete Wishart claimed the committee had shown a \"spectacular failure to grasp devolution\".<\/p><p>He added: \"This House of Lords report is irrelevant and adds nothing to the debate.

Attempted to shake-off his \"Red Ed\" tag by talking about the \"squeezed middle\" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction.<\/p>\r\n        <p>He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on \"refounding\" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire. <\/p>\r\n        <p>The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011.<\/p>\r\n  \r\n<h2 id=\"heading-2\">ED BALLS - SHADOW CHANCELLOR<\/h2>\r\n      <p>As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, <a href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/democracylive\/hi\/representatives\/profiles\/19497.stm\">at the age of 44<\/a>, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper. <\/p>\r\n  \r\n<h2 id=\"heading-3\">YVETTE COOPER - SHADOW HOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER FOR WOMEN AND EQUALITIES<\/h2>\r\n      <p>Popular throughout the party, the then <a href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/democracylive\/hi\/representatives\/profiles\/25691.stm\">42-year old<\/a> got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children. <\/p>\r\n  \r\n<h2 id=\"heading-4\">DOUGLAS ALEXANDER - SHADOW FOREIGN SECRETARY <\/h2>\r\n      <p>The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. <a href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/democracylive\/hi\/representatives\/profiles\/25705.stm\">Aged 43<\/a>, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign. <\/p>\r\n  \r\n<h2 id=\"heading-5\">TRISTRAM HUNT - SHADOW EDUCATION SECRETARY<\/h2>\r\n      <p>Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury.<\/p>\r\n  \r\n<h2 id=\"heading-6\">ANDY BURNHAM - SHADOW HEALTH SECRETARY<\/h2>\r\n      <p><a href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/democracylive\/hi\/representatives\/profiles\/25787.stm\">Turning 40<\/a> in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011. <\/p>\r\n  \r\n<h2 id=\"heading-7\">HARRIET HARMAN - DEPUTY LEADER AND SHADOW CULTURE SECRETARY<\/h2>\r\n      <p>Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the <a href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/democracylive\/hi\/representatives\/profiles\/25677.stm\">age of 56<\/a>. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development. <\/p>\r\n  \r\n<h2 id=\"heading-8\">RACHEL REEVES - SHADOW WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY<\/h2>\r\n      <p>Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. <a href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/democracylive\/hi\/representatives\/profiles\/35872.stm\">The MP for Leeds West<\/a> was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament.<\/p>\r\n  \r\n<h2 id=\"heading-9\">CHUKA UMUNNA - SHADOW BUSINESS SECRETARY<\/h2>\r\n      <p>A <a href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/democracylive\/hi\/representatives\/profiles\/72314.stm\">former employment lawyer<\/a> turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader. <\/p>\r\n  \r\n<h2 id=\"heading-10\">HILARY BENN - SHADOW COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT SECRETARY<\/h2>\r\n      <p>As the son of former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty.

But if - like them - you accept predictions that leaving the EU would cut economic growth, it is hard to imagine that would not hit the public finances. Such a scenario would require spending to be cut further, taxes to be increased or the period of austerity to be extended.<\/p><p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has released a report suggesting that the UK leaving the European Union could lead to austerity being extended by two years.<\/p><p>How did it get to that figure?<\/p><p>First of all, the IFS did not do its own economic modelling of the impact of a Brexit on the economy. Instead it used the National Institute of Economic and Social Research's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.niesr.ac.uk\/media\/economic-impact-leaving-eu-12503#.V0RcJ_krK71\">model<\/a>, which predicted that leaving the EU would lead to GDP in 2030 being between 1.5% and 7.8% lower than it would have been the UK stayed in the EU, depending on what sort of relationship ended up being negotiated with the single market.<\/p><div id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n    <div>\n        \n    <\/div>\n<\/div><p>The IFS actually says that the extra period of austerity would be between one and two years.<\/p><p>Its research has suggested that a 1% decline in in GDP increases borrowing for the government by 0.7% of GDP.<\/p><p>So, at the optimistic end of the NIESR predictions, in which the UK becomes part of the European Economic Area post-Brexit, the IFS reckons that in 2019-20, when the Chancellor wants to have a \u00a310.4bn economic surplus, we would actually have a \u00a317bn deficit. It says that the UK would need an extra 1.1 years of austerity at the current pace to turn around that deficit.<\/p>                                                                                                    <p>At the other end of the scale, NIESR's pessimistic forecast - in which the UK ends up trading under World Trade Organisation rules without special relationships with any other nation - the forecast is for a \u00a328bn deficit, which would take an extra two years to return to the \u00a310.4bn surplus.<\/p><h2>Following past trends<\/h2><p>So is all this convincing? First, it suffers from the same uncertainties involved in all economic forecasting, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-35862618\">which we have discussed in the past.<\/a><\/p><p>Second, the relationship of a 1% decline in GDP knocking 0.7% of GDP off the government's finances is an average based on past experience, caused by reduced tax revenue and increased demand for benefits; it will not necessarily happen like that in future. <\/p><p>The IFS sets out some of the reasons why the relationship may not be followed precisely.

The Labour Party has been doing it for decades (remember \"24 hours to save the NHS?\"). This ad claims the NHS is at \"breaking point\".<\/p><p>The central claim is that the UK sends \u00a3350m a week to the EU, a figure that has been <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36040060\">disputed by the BBC's Reality Check<\/a> and many others. And if we were to leave the EU it seems very unlikely that the money saved would be spent on building a \"brand new hospital every week\".<\/p><p>If you watch the broadcast carefully, there is wriggle room. \"We <i>could<\/i> spend the money on our priorities, <i>like<\/i> the NHS\" (my italics). <\/p><p>But the casual viewer (is there any other kind for election broadcasts?) would get the impression from this broadcast that the only way to save the NHS is to vote to leave on 23 June.

Both point to a recession in the short term, but in the case of the lesser \"shock\" scenario, while there would be an impact on the economy, the predicted recession would be very mild and well within the bounds of forecasting uncertainty. <\/p><p>The Treasury has released its analysis of the short-term effects of a vote to leave the European Union - that's what would happen in the two years after 23 June.<\/p><p>And it's not pretty - <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/524967\/hm_treasury_analysis_the_immediate_economic_impact_of_leaving_the_eu_web.pdf\">the Treasury predicts<\/a> that economic growth would decline, wages would be lower than if we'd stayed in and house prices would fall.<\/p><p>If you're prepared to be influenced by economic modelling (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-35862618\">read our Reality Check on the subject here<\/a>) then there is a simple message, which is that in the first two years, a vote to leave the EU would be a considerably bad thing for the economy.<\/p><div id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n    <div>\n        \n    <\/div>\n<\/div><p>If you want to go a bit further into the figures, there is more to say.<\/p><p>The Treasury no longer does economic forecasts - that job has now been given to the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).<\/p><p>What the Treasury is doing is what it calls scenario analysis, which is taking what would happen if we stayed in the EU as a base-line and then considering what the impact would be were we to leave.<\/p>                                                                                                    <p>So all the figures you see today are not how much worse things would be than they are today. They are how much worse things will be in two years if we leave the EU, than they would have been if we stayed in.<\/p><h2>'That's a recession'<\/h2><p>The Treasury has modelled two scenarios, the \"shock\" and the \"severe shock\" scenarios.<\/p><p>The shock scenario is what it reckons would happen if the country decided to negotiate a bilateral agreement to cover its relationship with the EU. The severe shock scenario is what would happen if we decided to trade as just another World Trade Organisation member, with no special relationship with the EU.<\/p><p>The Chancellor said in his speech: \"Within two years the size of our economy - our GDP - would be at least 3% smaller as a result of leaving the EU - and it could be as much as 6% smaller.\"<\/p><p>\"We'd have a year of negative growth - that's a recession.\"<\/p><p>But that doesn't mean it will be smaller than it is now, it means it will be smaller than it would have been had we stayed in.<\/p><p>If you compare that with the OBR's forecast for what will happen to the economy over the next couple of years (assuming we stay in) it turns out that under the shock scenario, in the first four quarters after the vote to leave, the economy would contract by 0.1% every quarter. <\/p><p>A recession is when you get at least two consecutive quarters (three month periods) in which the economy gets smaller. So that would be a recession, but not by very much. It would be well within the degree of uncertainty surrounding this sort of economic analysis.<\/p><p>Under the severe shock scenario, the expected contraction would be much more severe: - 1% in the first quarter and -0.4% in the following three quarters, before registering negligible growth in the following year.<\/p><p>The same may be done with other predictions in the report. <\/p><p>For example, the Treasury predicts house prices in two years would be between 10% and 18% lower than they would be if we had stayed in. The OBR forecasts house prices will rise by about 10% over that period, so if you put those predictions together for the two scenarios you get prices being either flat or falling by 8%.<\/p><hr><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"EU Referendum Reality Check\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/A862\/production\/_88460134_index_promo976.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"280\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n        <\/figure><p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/live\/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35603388\">Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate<\/a><\/p><hr><\/div>\n"},"Blair gives insight into Iraq response":{"link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-36371101#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa","description":"Blair hints at Chilcot response","content":"<div property=\"articleBody\" contentScore=\"2601\">\n                                                                                                    <figure><span>\n                \n                <img alt=\"Tony Blair speaking at an event in London\" src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/8942\/production\/_89783153_89783152.jpg\" width=\"976\" height=\"549\"><span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>PA<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    Tony Blair says the West faces a profound test of political will if it is to defeat jihaddism\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Tony Blair didn't utter the C word - he won't comment on the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war until the report is published on 6 July.<\/p><p>But at an event in central London organised by the Centre on Religion and Geopolitics - a think tank which he helped to set up - he made it clear he would be unapologetic for his role in taking Britain to war in 2003.<\/p><p>He certainly hadn't drawn the lesson that western military intervention in the Middle East was counter-productive. He talked of a \"generational struggle\" against so-called Islamic State, saying \"we are not being honest with our public if we are saying it is possible to defeat these people without making the commitment to defeat them and to do what it takes to defeat them\". <\/p><p>For him, that was likely to require Western boots on the ground:<\/p><p>\"You have got to defeat these people on the ground.

But how rare are these striking-looking crustaceans, asks Justin Parkinson.<\/p><p>Lobsters caught off the Atlantic coast of North America aren't usually very bright. They tend to be a murky, greeny-brown... until they are boiled, when they turn the orangey-pink familiar to diners with high disposable incomes.<\/p><p>So two fishermen off the coast of Nova Scotia made the news when they caught <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ctvnews.ca\/canada\/once-in-a-blue-lobster-two-rare-blue-crustaceans-caught-in-n-s-1.2913359\">not one, but two<\/a> vivid blue lobsters in quick succession, 150km (93 miles) apart. Among the region's fishermen, it's traditionally considered to be a sign of good fortune.<\/p><p>The probability of the creature having this colouring is widely touted as being one in two million. The <a href=\"http:\/\/umaine.edu\/lobsterinstitute\/files\/2011\/12\/LobsterColorsWeb.pdf\">University of Maine Lobster Institute<\/a> is among those to have quoted these odds in the past, though its executive director, Rob Bayer, admits they are merely a \"guess\".<\/p><p>\"The chances of this happening nobody really knows,\" he says.<\/p><div id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n    <div>\n        \n    <\/div>\n<\/div><aside><div>\n<h2>The answer<\/h2>\n<ul><li>It's been suggested that the odds are one in two million<\/li>\n<li>But these are largely a \"guess\", according to the US Lobster Institute<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/div><\/aside><p>David Spiegelhalter, professor for the public understanding of risk at Cambridge University in the UK, is inclined to pour a bit of cold water on the story.<\/p><p>A rough analysis of overall catch tonnages suggests that about 200 million lobsters are caught in the North Atlantic every year, he says.

The real sort of iridescent blue is still rare here, but the difference is that, to a European fisherman, it will seem less completely out of the ordinary than it would seem to a North American.\"<\/p><p>Ellis thinks the probability of a lobster being bright blue may be as low as one in a few hundred thousand.

best start in life\".<\/p><p>Recent government data showed that 7.3% of pupils (7,835) were in infant classes of over 30 pupils, an increase on the previous year.<\/p><p>Prof Reynolds said: \"If you look at the academic evidence you don't get much out of reducing class size.<\/p><p>\"If you're employing extra teachers or classroom assistants, that's going to cost you and you can find other policies - for example trying to improve teachers' capacity and knowledge about education and teaching skills.<\/p><p>\"You can find other policies which are much cheaper which will give you the same

harassed, bullied or abused by staff in 75% of so-called acute trusts (which include urgent services such as accident and emergency and maternity departments).<\/p><p>In one acute trust, where the biggest difference was reported, 41.7% of BME staff reported being harassed, bullied or abused by staff in comparison to 18.2% of white staff.<\/p><p>Some 81% of acute trusts also report a higher proportion of BME staff having personally experienced discrimination from a manager, team leader or colleague than white staff. <\/p><p>In 86% of acute trusts a higher percentage of BME staff said they did not believe their organisation offered equal opportunities for career progression or promotion in comparison with white staff. <\/p><p>Levels of harassment from relatives or the public remained broadly similar for BME and non-BME staff. <\/p><h2>'No complacency'<\/h2><p>Mr Stevens said the report provided \"unvarnished feedback\" to every hospital trust across the NHS. <\/p><p>\"It

policies.\" <\/p><p>NHS England says it will tackle the issue by introducing 75 \"champions\", who will work with trusts to reduce inequalities. <\/p><p>Mandip Kaur, from health think tank The King's Fund, said: \"This research confirms that significant numbers of NHS staff from black or ethnic minority backgrounds still experience more discrimination and bullying in the workplace than their white colleagues. <\/p><p>\"This not only affects staff morale and wellbeing, but can impact the quality of care received by patients. We know that the experience of BME staff is a very good barometer of the climate of respect and care within NHS organisations.\"<\/p><ul><li><\/ul><\/div>\n"},"New NHS safety body 'must be

independent, and to create a credible 'safe space' which will enable the NHS to properly learn from past mistakes. <\/p><p>\"The secretary of state's decision to set HSIB up as an NHS quango as a permanent response to our recommendations was both disappointing and would be unacceptable.<\/p><p>\"But the prospect of a secure legislative base will enable HSIB to emulate the successful air,

commitment to legislation, but say they will review how HSIB is working after two years.<\/p><p>Scandals at Mid Staffs and Southern Health Trust have highlighted failings in how the NHS responds to patients' complaints and deaths.<\/p><p>The MPs say the HSIB should be \"an exemplar of high quality clinical investigations\", with local NHS providers still carrying out the bulk of inquiries.<\/p><p>But the report warns there will be limits to what it can achieve, within its budget and remit. <\/p><h2>'Wide-reaching' public inquiry<\/h2><p>The MPs also recommend that a single public inquiry selects and reviews historical cases of failings in the health service.<\/p><p>They say: \"This should be seen in the context of other wide-reaching inquiries in recent years, such as the public inquiry into historic child sexual abuse, the inquiry into the Hillsborough disaster, and the Savile inquiry into the events of Bloody Sunday. <\/p><p>\"The purpose of this single public inquiry would be to provide closure to those affected by patient safety incidents, which cannot otherwise be obtained.\"<\/p><p>Patient safety campaigners at the charity Action against Medical Accidents (AvMA) questioned whether the no-blame approach was the right one.<\/p><p>Its chief executive Peter Walsh said: \"We believe that both PACAC and the government are wrong to prioritise the creation of a so-called 'safe space' for health professionals above guaranteeing openness and honesty with patients or their families about their own treatment. <\/p><p>\"This would undermine public confidence in HSIB and run against the principle of the newly created duty of candour. <\/p><p>\"Of course we do want to see protection of staff who do the right thing, but most health professionals would agree that denying patients access to the truth is no way to do that.\"<\/p><p>A Department of Health spokeswoman said: \"The new independent HSIB will carry out investigations and share its findings to improve patient safety. <\/p><p>\"We agree that the independence of the branch will be essential to its success, which is why we made explicit legal provisions for its independence when we

consultant said.<\/p><p>Dr Chris Danbury, an anaesthetist at Reading's Royal Berkshire Hospital, said it should be made a legal requirement in England and Wales. <\/p><p>Examples of when mediation should be used include disagreements in whether to turn off life support, he said.<\/p><p>This would avoid a case going to the Court of Protection.<\/p><p>Another instance where mediation could be used was when a patient who is mentally competent did not want to accept a treatment they medically needed.<\/p><div id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n    <div>\n        \n    <\/div>\n<\/div><p>But one mother, whose son died of a brain tumour, said she was not sure mediation was the best form of persuasion for parents at a vulnerable time.<\/p><p>Dr Danbury, a consultant intensive care physician, said it was not just the cost of going to court that was the problem.<\/p><p>He said the legal route could have a damaging effect on the relationship between the medical team and the family involved.<\/p><h2>'Immense savings'<\/h2>                                                                                                    <p>Speaking at Euroanaesthesia 2016, Mr Danbury said of mediation: \"This can be done informally, perhaps by getting another clinician within the institution to act as an 'honest broker'.<\/p><p>\"If this fails, then a formal mediation process can be initiated with legal representation on both sides.<\/p><p>\"Mediation costs a great deal less than going to court and often preserves the relationship between clinical team and their patient\/representatives, which can otherwise be severely damaged by the rigors of court proceedings.\"<\/p><p>He highlighted one example in which a Jewish family refused to accept their family member had no hope of recovery. <\/p><p>They were offered mediation with the help of a local rabbi, which led to an improved relationship between them and the medical team and the family agreed to switch off the patient's life support machine.<\/p><p>\"Sometimes misunderstandings can occur very easily - one doctor may not explain something very well to a family, but then once a colleague intervenes, the situation can be calmed down very quickly,\" he said.<\/p><p>\"But if this should fail, then the default option should be to go to formal mediation by an independent third party.<\/p><p>\"It's never too late to talk, and the cost savings to the UK NHS, or in fact any other country doing this, would be immense.\"<\/p><h2>Court pressures<\/h2><p>He told BBC Breakfast: \"The hardest thing I do is talk to families of critically ill patients. Very occasionally the relationship between the family and clinical teams break down and we have to have a way of resolving that. <\/p><p>\"Court is an incredibly pressured environment and it's much better to talk than litigate in our view. It's about allowing a conversation, which perhaps has broken down between the clinical team and the family, to continue and trying to take the pressure out of it.\"<\/p><h2>Lifelong consequences<\/h2><p>Debbie Whiteley, whose son Tom died from a brain tumour when he was nine years old, said parents of seriously ill children in hospital were very vulnerable.<\/p><p>\"We asked a lot of questions,\" she said. \"You know you spend a lot of time on Google search. You become very institutionalised and it's a really vulnerable time. <\/p><p>\"I worry about mediation because it's fine as a form of explanation but not as a form of persuasion. <\/p><p>\"Whatever the outcome, you know you, as parents, have to life with that for the rest of your life.\"<\/p>\n                                                                                                <\/div>\n"},"Flat lens promises revolution in optics":{"link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/science-environment-36438686#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa","description":"A flat lens made of paint whitener on a sliver of glass could revolutionise optics, its US inventors say.","content":"<div property=\"articleBody\" contentScore=\"3951\">\n                                                                                                    <figure><span>\n                \n                <img alt=\"structure of the lens seen under microscope\" src=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/4570\/production\/_89867771_-sems_scalebar2micronmeter.jpg\" width=\"976\" height=\"549\"><span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>Federico Capasso<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    This electron microscope image shows the structure of the lens (white line is 0.002mm long)\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>A flat lens made of paint whitener on a sliver of glass could revolutionise optics, according to its US inventors.<\/p><p>Just 2mm across and finer than a human hair, the tiny device can magnify nanoscale objects and gives a sharper focus than top-end microscope lenses.<\/p><p>It is the latest example of the power of metamaterials, whose novel properties emerge from their structure.<\/p><p>Shapes on the surface of this lens are smaller than the wavelength of light involved: a thousandth of a millimetre.<\/p><p>\"In my opinion, this technology will be game-changing,\" said Federico Capasso of Harvard University, the senior author of a report on the new lens which appears <a href=\"http:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/cgi\/doi\/10.1126\/science.aaf6644\">in the journal Science<\/a>.<\/p><div id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n    <div>\n        \n    <\/div>\n<\/div><p>The lens is quite unlike the curved disks of glass familiar from cameras and binoculars.

I think it is no exaggeration to say that this is potentially revolutionary.\"<\/p><p>Those comparisons were made against top-end lenses used in research microscopes, designed to achieve absolute maximum magnification. The focal spot of the flat lens was typically 30% sharper than its competition, meaning that in a lab setting, finer details can be revealed.<\/p><p>But the technology could be revolutionary for another reason, Prof Capasso maintains. <\/p><p>\"The conventional fabrication of shaped lenses depends on moulding and essentially goes back to 19th Century technology. <\/p><p>\"But our lenses, being planar, can be fabricated in the same foundries that make computer chips. So all of a sudden the factories that make integrated circuits can make our lenses.\"<\/p><p>And with ease. Electronics manufacturers making microprocessors and memory chips routinely craft components far smaller than the pillars in the flat lenses. Yet a memory chip containing billions of components may cost just a few pounds.<\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"two lenses side by side\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/E1B0\/production\/_89867775_img_1040.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>Federico Capasso<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    The lens is much more compact than a traditional microscope objective\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Mass production is the key to managing costs, which is why Prof Capasso sees cell-phone cameras as an obvious target. Most of their other components, including the camera's detector, are already made with chip technology. Extending that to include the lens would be natural, he argues.<\/p><p>There are many other potential uses: mass-produced cameras for quality control in factories, light-weight optics for virtual-reality headsets, even contact lenses. \"We can make these on soft materials,\" Prof Capasso assured the BBC.<\/p><p>The prototypes lenses are 2mm across, but only because of the limitations of the Harvard manufacturing equipment. In principle, the method could scale to any size, Prof Capasso said. <\/p><p>\"Once you have the foundry - you want a 12-inch lens? Feel free, you can make a 12-inch lens. There's no limit.\"<\/p><p>The precise character of the lens depends on the layout and composition of the pillars. Paint-whitener - titanium dioxide - is used to make the pillars, because it is transparent and interacts strongly with visible light. It is also cheap. <\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"illustration of light hitting the lens\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/5B64\/production\/_89869332_116633.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"976\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>Peter Allen\/Harvard<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    The minuscule pillars have a powerful effect on light passing through\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The team has previously worked with silicon, which functions well in the infrared.

diseases that have been virtually eliminated from the UK but could make a comeback. <\/p><p>The combined vaccine, called Boostrix IPV,  had a take up rate in England of 62% in 2014.<\/p><p>The vital contribution of maternal vaccination is seen more dramatically elsewhere around the globe. <\/p><p>In 2008, there were an estimated 16 million cases of pertussis worldwide and 195,000 deaths. <\/p><p>In those countries where maternal vaccination programmes have been introduced, deaths have dropped sharply.<\/p><p>Flu vaccination is also recommended for women during pregnancy to protect themselves, their unborn child and the newborn in its first few months. <\/p><p>A woman's immune system is weakened naturally during pregnancy, to prevent her body rejecting the baby. <\/p><p>But this makes her more vulnerable to infections such as flu.<\/p><p>Vaccination of the mother during pregnancy also confers protection on her child and has been shown to reduce cases of flu in newborns by 63%.<\/p><h2>'Vigorous support' needed<\/h2><p>Maternal vaccination against flu was recommended as far back as 1960 in the US and in 2005 by the World Health Organization (WHO). <\/p><p>In England, it was first recommended for pregnant women during the swine flu pandemic of 2009. <\/p><p>But take-up rates for the vaccine are low, at 44% in England in 2015. <\/p><p>The biggest maternal vaccination success story - on a global scale - is against tetanus, the deadly infection marked by muscle spasms caused by a bacterium in the soil getting into a wound. <\/p><p>More than one million people died each year from tetanus in the 1980s, about three-quarters of them infants in the first month of life.<\/p><p>Today, the toll of neonatal deaths has been reduced by over 90% and maternal and neonatal tetanus has been eliminated from all but 22 countries.<\/p><p>In a paper summarising these findings, <a href=\"http:\/\/content.healthaffairs.org\/content\/35\/2\/309.abstract)\">published in the US Journal Health Affairs<\/a> and based on a policy briefing presented to the <a href=\"http:\/\/wish-qatar.org\/research\/reports\/maternal-and-newborn-health-en\">World Innovation Summit for Health (WISH) in Doha<\/a>, Mark Steedman, of the Institute of Global Health Innovation, and I, together with colleagues, call on governments to recognise the extraordinary benefits achieved by maternal vaccination and to focus efforts on extending its reach. <\/p><p>Millions of mothers and newborns still die each year from infectious diseases, and a number of other vaccines are in the pipeline that could be used in pregnant women.<\/p><p>One study <a href=\"http:\/\/contemporaryobgyn.modernmedicine.com\/contemporary-obgyn\/news\/what-patients-think-about-flu-and-tdap-vaccination-pregnancy\">published  in the US this month<\/a> showed that in one health system (Geisinger in Danville, Pennsylvania) 70% of pregnant women were vaccinated against flu and 76% against pertussis, tetanus and diphtheria  - much higher than the figures for the UK (44 and 62%). <\/p><p>Patient education and physician recommendation were the key factors, according to the researchers. <\/p><p>Ministers must ensure these are vigorously supported and pregnant women urged to seek protection for themselves and their unborn children. <\/p><p>The power of vaccination in pregnancy is a message that should be broadcast far and wide. <\/p><p>Lord Darzi is a surgeon, director of The Institute of Global Health Innovation, and executive chairman of the World Innovation Summit for Health, an initiative of the Qatar Foundation.

Despite the complexity of the material, the lead author's message is simple. <\/p><p>\"There are only a few high-quality studies into pregnancy among elite athletes or those who exercise a great deal, but it seems that many do continue to exercise during pregnancy, and it does not affect them in a negative way,\" says Prof Kari Bo from the Norwegian School of Sports Sciences. \"It doesn't seem to harm either the foetus or the mother.\"<\/p><p>These athletes are no more at risk of problematic pregnancies or birth defects, though Bo says that when such things do occur people often mistakenly make a link to physical activity during pregnancy. At the same time, there is no evidence that athletes have an easier time during pregnancy or childbirth. <\/p><p>Historically, advice given to pregnant women relating to exercise has been muddled and speculative. For a long time exercise was simply thought to conflict with a woman's reproductive ability. The roots of this feeling were unscientific, and more to do with gender roles than with the health of mother or baby.<\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"A woman training in a gym\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/10E02\/production\/_89822196_istock_000092832735_large.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"700\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>iStock<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    Elite athletes often feel they have to figure out what exercise they should and shouldn't do for themselves\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>But in the 1980s some researchers began to reason that the demands exercise placed on a woman's body - in terms of oxygen, blood flow, nutrients and temperature - were similar to those made by a foetus. So if pregnant women exercised, these doctors suggested, the foetus might lose out in a battle for resources.<\/p><p>\"In a way it's correct,\" says Bo. \"But women who are athletic also have very good blood distribution, so it doesn't seem to do any harm to the foetus, and at the same time it's obvious that the placenta is also better nourished when you are exercising, so there's a sort of compensation going on.\"<\/p><aside><div>\n<span><\/span><blockquote>\"I think if he had been a little baby, maybe people would have asked me if it had been a good decision to train. <footer>Eva Nystrom, Swedish athlete<\/footer><\/blockquote>\n<\/div><\/aside><p>Pregnant women have improved temperature regulation (which is why they may sweat more) and greater cardiovascular capacity.

If you do something that feels wrong, it's probably best to stop.<\/p><p>\"The few studies that we have, they show that pregnant athletes are reducing the intensity and the frequency of training by themselves,\" says Bo. \"This happens when your tummy is growing and you can feel the child jumping up and down with you - it doesn't feel very good.\"<\/p><hr><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"A man and a pregnant woman training\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/137C4\/production\/_89821897_istock_000065786679_large.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>iStock<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n        <\/figure><p><strong>Pregnancy and training: Four tips<\/strong><\/p><p>Prof Kari Bo believes women athletes are their own best judges when it comes to training during pregnancy - but she has a few tips:<\/p><ul><li>For the first trimester (12-week period) it's best to avoid getting too hot, so consider wearing light clothing, exercising in air-conditioned environments, and refraining from strenuous exercise on the hottest days<\/li><\/ul><ul><li>Female weight-lifters should probably reduce the weight they lift, since it may increase blood pressure, stop blood flow to the foetus and strain the pelvic floor <\/li><\/ul><ul><li>Scuba diving is not advisable during pregnancy, and women in their final trimester may also wish to avoid participating in sports such as football or hockey where they may have a fall or collision<\/li>\n<li>A small study of Olympic athletes showed that blood flow to the foetus was reduced when the mother exercised above 90% of maximal oxygen consumption - in practice this means that moderate exercise in training is fine, but pregnant women should refrain from maximal efforts during endurance training<\/li>\n<\/ul><hr><p>The new research fits with current advice for the general public.

BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"There are two problems that seem to have confronted the Home Office. The first is the unwillingness of some countries to take their citizens back, but also I think it is the process that we have.\"<\/p><p>Mr Vaz suggested that foreign offenders should give up their passports when they are sentenced and that when they come out of prison the process of removing them from the country should start immediately.<\/p><p>\"The public would expect our membership of the European Union to make it easier to deport European offenders, but this is clearly not the case, and we continue to keep thousands of these criminals at great and unnecessary expense,\" he said.<\/p><p>Mr Vaz also called on Commonwealth countries to \"take their citizens back\", saying there was a high number of foreign national offenders from Jamaica, Pakistan, Nigeria and India.<\/p><p>John Attard of the Prison Governors' Association also told the programme that it was up to the Border Agency to remove foreign national offenders, adding that paying for prisoners who could be incarcerated elsewhere was a drain on resources.<\/p><h2>'Less safe'<\/h2><p>Vote Leave claimed the foreign offenders were costing \u00a336,000 a year each to jail, and that the EU made it \"more difficult\" to deport overseas criminals.<\/p><p>Justice Minister Dominic Raab, who backs Brexit, said: \"The EU is making us less safe. If we take back control we will be able to deport foreign criminals from our prisons.\"<\/p><p>But Home Secretary Theresa May, who backs remaining in the EU but <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36128318\">withdrawing from the European Convention on Human Rights<\/a>, said foreign criminals \"should be in no doubt of our determination to deport them\".<\/p><p>\"Last year we removed a record number of foreign national offenders from this country, including a record number of EU criminals,\" she said.<\/p><p>\"Being in the EU gives us access to criminal records sharing and prisoner transfer agreements which help us better identify people with criminal records and, allow us to send foreign criminals back to their home countries to serve their sentences.\"<\/p><p>MPs also warned it would take a \"modern miracle\" for David Cameron to meet his \"no ifs, no buts\" pledge to cut migration to under 100,000. <\/p><p>Latest figures from the Office for National Statistics estimate <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36382199\">net migration to the UK rose to 333,000 in 2015<\/a> -

into balance as the economies of countries such as France and Germany picked up.<\/p><p>\"I'm not going to put a date on it,\" he said. \"There are good ways of controlling migration and there are bad ways.\"<\/p><p>He said a \"good way\" was to ensure new arrivals did not claim unemployment benefit and left after six months if they did not have a job - as he had done in his renegotiation - as well as ensuring people \"make a contribution\" for four years before getting full welfare access. <\/p><p>He added: \"It would be madness to try to do that by trashing our economy and pulling out of the single market.\"<\/p><h2>'Drives me crazy'<\/h2><p>In a wide-ranging discussion, which included accusations from audience members of \"scaremongering\", \"hypocrisy\"  and \"waffling\" by Mr Cameron, the prime minister admitted \"frustrations\" with the EU but said many had been addressed.<\/p><p>\"Sometimes this organisation drives me crazy. But do I sit there and think Britain would be better off if we left? Are we quitters? Do we think we quit the EU, we quit the single market and somehow we will be better off? Absolutely not.\"<\/p><p>He said the EU would still exist but, if the UK backed Brexit, the UK would be left outside the negotiating room, \"our nose pressed to the window, trying to find out what decision they were making\", adding: \"That would be terrible.\"<\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Nigel Farage speaks to the media\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/10439\/production\/_89871666_9875d57a-ba1e-4676-8c93-d403eb2166d8.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>PA<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    Nigel Farage spoke to the media after the debate and accused Mr Cameron of 'lying'\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>But former Conservative cabinet minister Iain Duncan Smith said it was \"telling\" that the PM refused to set any date for cutting net migration below 100,000.<\/p><p>\"I thought that was a telling moment because he realised it is difficult to achieve that without coming out of the EU and close our borders,\" said Mr Duncan Smith.<\/p><p>\"All that stuff about, if we leave the EU it induces the likelihood of war, the audience laughed at that. <\/p><p>\"I thought that was the most telling bit because they are fed up with the scaremongering. It shows the way they were going about their business was to scare people to stay in.\"<\/p><h2>'Doesn't add up'<\/h2><p>UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Cameron had constantly referred to the single market adding: \"It sounds lovely and cuddly and fluffy but actually this referendum is about political union and the single market is actually the embodiment of it.

I've said repeatedly before that I personally would hope and wish for the UK to stay part and parcel of the EU.\"<\/p><hr><h2>Analysis: BBC Berlin correspondent Jenny Hill<\/h2><p>Angela Merkel has been reluctant to intervene in the referendum debate. She's made no secret of the fact that she wants Britain to stay in the EU; it's an important economic and political ally for Germany. <\/p><p>But she's understood to be concerned about how any comments might be interpreted by British voters. Which is why today's intervention is interesting. Mrs Merkel was relatively cautious. She was careful to emphasise that this is, after all, a British decision. <\/p>                                                                                                    <p>And then - in characteristically guarded language - a warning. The EU, she said,  would never compromise with an outsider in the same way it would with a member state. <\/p><p>Mrs Merkel's comments may have been timed to coincide with those of other European leaders who've made it plain that they'd be in no hurry in the event of a Brexit to help the UK renegotiate rights and access. But her intervention certainly reflects a growing unease in Berlin that a Brexit has become a realistic possibility. <\/p><hr><p>She said: \"We work well together with the UK particularly when we talk about new rules for the EU. <\/p><p>\"We have to develop those together with the UK and whenever we negotiate that, you can much better have an influence on the debate when you sit at the bargaining table and you can give input to those negotiations and the result will then invariably be better rather than being outside of the room.\"<\/p><p>She stressed the importance of the single market  - a free trade area which also includes the free movement of goods, people and capital - and said countries outside the EU \"will never get a really good result in negotiations\". <\/p>\n\n<div

added.<\/p><h2>'Generation debt'<\/h2><p>Liberal Democrat Tim Farron attacked Mr Fox's argument, arguing that leaving the EU would \"destroy young people's hopes of getting on the housing ladder\".<\/p><p>\"Leaving would mean fewer jobs, higher prices and lower pay, making deposits harder or impossible to build up. And it means higher mortgage payments making first time loans less affordable. <\/p><p>\"First time buyers are better off in Europe and leaving would be a leap in the dark leaving young people worse off,\" the Remain campaigner added.<\/p><p>House builders also criticised Mr Fox's argument - saying the construction of new homes would stall if Britain left the EU.<\/p><p>James Hopkins, executive

Jeremy Corbyn is campaigning to stay in the European Union. In fact nearly all of the Labour Party is. <\/p><p>But if you didn't know that, and you listened to his speech this morning, you would not have left the room with that overwhelming sense. <\/p><p>Mr Corbyn said the Labour message was \"loud and clear\", that the Conservative Party was a bigger threat to the country than the European Union was, and that whether on workers' rights, the environment, or renewable energy, Britain can achieve more progressive policies working with other countries in the EU than alone. <\/p><p>But as part of his \"Remain and Reform\" agenda, the Labour leader listed almost as many downsides with the EU as positives. <\/p><p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36439905\">Read more from Laura<\/a><\/p><hr><p>On Jeremy Corbyn -

had already drawn up a plan to carry out air drops to besieged areas, but that it would need Syrian government approval and funding for the operation.<\/p><hr><h2>Air delivery: 'Challenging'<\/h2><p>In February, the WFP carried out a 21-pallet air drop of aid to a government-held area of Deir al-Zour in eastern Syria, which <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-middle-east-35658287\">ended in failure.<\/a> Of the 21 pallets, 10 were unaccounted for, seven landed in no-man's land and four were damaged.<\/p><p>But it has since carried out 44 air drops over the city, delivering mainly rice, chickpeas and beans to meet the immediate needs of around 100,000 residents.<\/p><p>The WFP has identified some 592,700 people in 19 besieged areas of Syria that may need to receive aid by air.<\/p><p>But the operating conditions are challenging, the WFP says. Many besieged locations are in built-up, urban areas with no suitable space for a drop zone. High-altitude drops are not possible in those areas because of the risk of harming people on the ground.<\/p><p>The UN food agency says airdrops are always a last resort as access by land is more efficient.<\/p><hr><p>Meanwhile, aircraft from the US-led coalition fighting so-called Islamic State (IS) in Syria dropped ammunition to rebels in the town of Marea, in Aleppo province, the UK-based monitoring group Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.<\/p><p>It was not clear if weapons were also delivered.<\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Map\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/13C92\/production\/_89824018_syriamarea4640516.png\" data-width=\"464\" data-height=\"261\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n        <\/figure><p>Rebels are fighting IS militants, who cut off supply routes between Marea and Azaz, both under rebel control, near the Turkish border.<\/p><p>The area between the city of Aleppo and the Turkish border is split between IS, rebel and government-controlled zones.<\/p><p>The US is also supporting an offensive by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), made up by Kurdish and Arab fighters, against IS-held Manbij.<\/p>\n                                                                                                <\/div>\n"},"Hubble clocks faster cosmic expansion":{"link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/science-environment-36441219#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa","description":"The Universe may be expanding up to 9% faster than previously thought, according to new measurements from the Hubble Space Telescope.","content":"<div property=\"articleBody\" contentScore=\"3902\">\n                                                                                                    <figure><span>\n                \n                <img alt=\"A Hubble Space Telescope image of the galaxy UGC 9391, one of the galaxies in the new survey\" src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/80F9\/production\/_89871033_heic1611c.jpg\" width=\"976\" height=\"549\"><span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>NASA\/ESA<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    A Hubble Space Telescope image of UGC 9391, one of the galaxies in the new survey\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The Universe may be expanding up to 9% faster than previously thought.<\/p><p>This new assessment comes from the Hubble Space Telescope, which has significantly refined the rate at which nearby galaxies are observed to be moving away from each other.<\/p><p>It reinforces the tension between what we see happening locally and what we would expect from the conditions that existed in the early cosmos.<\/p><p>These have implied a much more sedate trajectory for the recession.<\/p><p>Science now has a big job on its hands to try to resolve the conundrum, says <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Adam_Riess\">Adam Riess<\/a> from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.stsci.edu\/portal\/\">Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)<\/a> and the Johns Hopkins University, both in Baltimore, Maryland, US. <\/p><div id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n    <div>\n        \n    <\/div>\n<\/div><p>\"To be honest, with this latest measurement we've really gone beyond what we might call 'tension';

and a group of exploding objects referred to as a Type 1a supernovae.<\/p><p>Both shine with a known power output, and so by comparing this quantity with their apparent brightness on the sky, it is possible to figure out their separation from Earth and thus, also, the distance to the galaxies that host them. <\/p><p>Some 2,400 cepheids in 19 nearby galaxies were used in the survey, and these helped calibrate roughly 300 Type 1a supernovae, whose particular properties enabled the team to probe a slightly deeper volume of space. <\/p><p>The work gives a number for the Hubble Constant of 73.24 kilometres per second per megaparsec (a megaparsec is 3.26 million light-years). Or put another way - the expansion increases by 73.24km\/second for every 3.26 million light-years we look further out into space.<\/p><p>It means basically that the distance between cosmic objects will double in another 9.8 billion years.<\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Planck\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/23A7\/production\/_89872190_fig1.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>ESA<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    Artist's impression: Planck surveyed the oldest light in the Universe to understand its constituents\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>This is the third iteration of the project led by Dr Riess and has an uncertainty of just 2.4%.<\/p><p>But there is another way to determine the constant, and that is to look at the expansion shortly after the Big Bang and to use what we know about the contents and the physics at work in the Universe to predict a modern value of the expansion.<\/p><p>This has been done using data acquired by the Planck space telescope, which earlier this decade made the most detailed ever <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/science-environment-21866464\">observations of the oldest light in the Universe<\/a>. <\/p><p>Its Hubble Constant value was 66.53km\/s per megaparsec. <\/p><p>The disagreement with Dr Riess's number is more than just a minor inconvenience.

supporters of her Democratic rival Bernie Sanders ahead of the California primary on Tuesday.<\/p><p>Instead she came out swinging against Donald Trump in a scathing speech that made clear she's looking to appeal to a broad centre in the general election. <\/p><p>Billed as a national security speech, her address lacked any new proposals. Instead it was a forceful, often mocking, rebuke of the presumptive Republican nominee, as she framed her pitch in patriotic terms that could also resonate with Republicans. <\/p><p>Mrs. Clinton presented herself as the real defender of American values and a commander-in-chief with a steady hand who believed in America as an exceptional country.   <\/p><p>Mr Trump on the other hand, \"believes America is weak. An embarrassment. He called our military a disaster. He said we are, and I quote, a third-world country,\" said Mrs Clinton, speaking in San Diego, a city with 95,000 military personnel. <\/p><div id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n    <div>\n        \n    <\/div>\n<\/div><ul><li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-us-canada-36439151\">Hillary Clinton: Donald Trump is 'dangerously incoherent'<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/election-us-2016-36372929\">Why has Trump caught Clinton in the polls?<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-us-canada-36270326\">How Trump can capture the White House<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/election-us-2016-36232271\">Trump v Clinton on foreign policy<\/a><\/li>\n<li><a href=\"\/news\/blogs-echochambers-31806900\">What's Hillary Clinton's plan?<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Mrs Clinton was introduced by the spouse of an active duty naval officer and spoke with 20 US flags prominently displayed behind her. <\/p><figure><div>\n            <figure data-playable=\"{\"settings\":{\"counterName\":\"news.election.us2016.story.36438555.page\",\"edition\":\"Domestic\",\"pageType\":\"eav2\",\"uniqueID\":\"36438555\",\"ui\":{\"locale\":{\"lang\":\"en-gb\"}},\"externalEmbedUrl\":\"http:\\\/\\\/www.bbc.co.uk\\\/news\\\/election-us-2016-36438555\\\/embed\",\"insideIframe\":false,\"statsObject\":[],\"playlistObject\":{\"title\":\"Hillary Clinton: \\\"Donald Trump's ideas aren't just different, they are dangerously incoherent\\\"\",\"holdingImageURL\":null,\"guidance\":null,\"simulcast\":false,\"liveRewind\":false,\"embedRights\":\"blocked\",\"items\":[{\"vpid\":\"p03x3glq\",\"live\":false,\"duration\":149,\"kind\":\"programme\"}],\"summary\":\"Hillary Clinton: \\\"Donald Trump's ideas aren't just different, they are dangerously incoherent\\\"\"}},\"otherSettings\":{\"advertisingAllowed\":true,\"continuousPlayCfg\":{\"enabled\":false},\"isAutoplayOnForAudience\":false,\"unProcessedImageUrl\":\"http:\\\/\\\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\\\/news\\\/640\\\/cpsprodpb\\\/8ABD\\\/production\\\/_89871553_89871552.jpg\"}}\"><\/figure><\/div>\n    <figcaption><span>Media caption<\/span>Hillary Clinton: \"Donald Trump's ideas aren't just different, they are dangerously incoherent\"<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Although still fighting a primary, Mrs. Clinton is clearly making a play for independent and Republican voters who are concerned about Mr Trump's erratic foreign policy pronouncements but also his statements on women, Mexican immigrants and Muslims. On Thursday, the head of Hispanic media relations for the Republican National Committee, Ruth Guerra, resigned. <\/p><p>Mrs Clinton has always had the potential to appeal to moderate Republicans turned off by their party's stance on social issues such as gay marriage, abortion and even guns, but who feel she is tough enough on foreign policy.   <\/p>                                                                                                    <p>In late April, during her <a href=\"http:\/\/edition.cnn.com\/videos\/politics\/2016\/04\/27\/hillary-clinton-super-tuesday-entire-victory-speech-pennsylvania-sot.cnn\">speech after her victory in the Pennsylvania primary<\/a>, Mrs Clinton appealed to \"thoughtful\" Republicans, independents and Democrats to stand together against divisive candidates on the Republican side. <\/p><p>Although House speaker <a href=\"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/news\/2016\/06\/02\/paul-ryan-will-vote-for-donald-trump-despite-their-differences\/\">Paul Ryan finally endorsed Donald Trump<\/a> on Thursday after weeks of hesitation, Republicans are not rushing to back the presumptive Republican nominee just yet. At least nine Republican governors, and a number of senators, are steering clear from their party convention in July. <\/p><p>There has also been a trickle of lifelong, prominent Republicans who openly say they will vote for a Democrat for the first time in their life in November. <\/p><p>Mrs Clinton's message on American global leadership may not resonate widely with the GOP (Grand Old Party; Republican) base which is turning more isolationist - but it is finding an audience with many moderates and foreign policy thinkers. <\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Donald Trump\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/1597\/production\/_89872550_88911711.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>Reuters<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    Donald Trump has caused divisions in the Republican party\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>On Twitter, the hashtag #RepublicansforHillary was trending for a day this week, after an interview on US cable TV with a former Reagan administration official, Doug Elmets, who said that \"four years of Hillary Clinton is better than one day with Donald Trump as president\". <\/p><p>Widely quoted in the US media as well was retired army colonel Peter Mansoor, a former aide to General David Petraeus during the Iraq war. <\/p><p>Mr Mansoor said he would be voting for Mrs Clinton not because he had converted to being a Democrat, but because Mr Trump was dangerous. <\/p><p>Elections are not won on Twitter and a handful of Republicans won't tip the balance in November, but the chatter on social media is bringing out voices from the Republican party silent during the raucous days of the Republican primaries and raising questions about a ripple effect. <\/p><p>Mr Trump has been criticised by leading names such as former secretary of defence <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/entry\/robert-gates-donald-trump-foreign-policy_us_5738a1afe4b077d4d6f3527b\">Robert Gates<\/a>, former CIA director <a href=\"http:\/\/www.huffingtonpost.com\/entry\/michael-hayden-donald-trump-isis_us_574c46f1e4b0dacf7ad53d08\">Michael Hayden<\/a>, former Bush administration spokesperson Tony Fratto, historian Max Boot and commentator David Frum, a former speechwriter for George W Bush. <\/p><p>Clinton campaign aides were not willing to discuss their strategy to appeal to moderate Republicans, especially while the Democratic primary is still under way. But they acknowledged there were Republicans, particularly those concerned with foreign policy issues, who could support her. <\/p><p>Vin Weber, a former Reagan official who supported Jeb Bush in the primaries, said Mrs Clinton should enlist Republican advisors. <\/p><p>\"If she were campaigning like her husband, she would move to the centre, and try to get votes that are not locked up by the Republican Party,\" said Mr Weber, who said he was still doing some hard thinking about how to vote in November. <\/p><p>Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg says a recent poll shows moderate Republicans represent a \"stunning 31% of the GOP base\", what he describes the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.washingtonpost.com\/opinions\/republicans-beware-moderates-could-help-elect-clinton\/2016\/05\/12\/f583bdd6-0e4c-11e6-8ab8-9ad050f76d7d_story.html\">alienated third of the party<\/a>.<\/p><p>\"They are disproportionately college graduates in a white, working-class party, and they are socially liberal.\" <\/p><p>On marriage equality, climate change or abortion rights, those GOP moderates are more in sync with the Democratic party. The poll, conducted in February when all the Republican candidates were still in the race, showed that 10% of Republican moderates would vote for Clinton. <\/p><p>Kori Schake, a fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution, said that Clinton's challenge would be to convince anti-Trump Republicans they actually need to vote for her - not simply refrain from voting for Mr Trump. <\/p><p>\"Republican refuseniks are not enough to make a difference,\" she said.<\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Bernie Sanders\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/DFEE\/production\/_89562375_89562374.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>AP<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    Many of Bernie Sanders' supporters feel alienated by Mrs Clinton\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Ms Schake said presenting Mr Trump as dangerous was an effective strategy, but it was also key for Mrs Clinton to frame her pitch in economic terms.<\/p><p>She had to press home the damage she believed a Trump presidency would cause to the economy - but to do so would require moving decisively to the right of Mr Sanders, and risk alienating many in her own party.<\/p><p>\"I've just come back from Cuba, and I've seen what a Sanders economy looks like,\" said Ms Schake. <\/p><p>Mrs Clinton will seek to unify the Democratic party ahead of the convention, She will not undo the positions she has taken during the drawn-out primaries to appeal to the Democratic base. <\/p><p>But to win those moderates Republicans, she will now need to present herself not just as the candidate of her party's middle but of America's centre. <\/p>\n                                                                                                <\/div>\n"},"Somalia hopes for better future despite attacks":{"link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-africa-36440209#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa","description":"Somalis hope for better future despite attacks","content":"<div property=\"articleBody\" contentScore=\"6985\">\n                                                                                                    <figure><span>\n                \n                <img alt=\"Scene of bomb attack on Ambassador Hotel in Mogadishu on 1 June 2016\" src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/93FD\/production\/_89858873_89858870.jpg\" width=\"976\" height=\"549\"><span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>AFP<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    The car bomb caused extensive damage to the hotel\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The cool new rooftop pizza joint was buzzing with the hip kids snapping selfies and watching the sun set over Mogadishu when the deep crunch of an explosion made everyone jump.<\/p><p>A thick and acrid plume of smoke drifted up from behind one of the nearby high buildings and the crowd started to realise it was another bomb blast in their city.<\/p><p>We heard a sporadic crack of gunfire and then the sound of sirens - as ambulances headed to the scene through the city's congested streets.<\/p><p>The huge suicide car bomb had been just the start of the attack. <\/p><p>Al-Shabab fighters had used it to breach the front entrance of the Ambassador Hotel and had rushed in, opening fire.<\/p><div id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n    <div>\n        \n    <\/div>\n<\/div><p>It's a fortified residence used by high-profile Somalis and members of parliament - two British-Somali MPs were killed along with around a dozen other people.

In 1990 the idea that you could be raped on a date was not widely understood, but Koestner went public with her story and - as she explains here - the concept of \"date rape\" took root for the first time. Some readers may find her account disturbing.<\/p><p>I grew up in Atlanta, Georgia. I had a younger sister, a full-time mom, and my dad was an FBI agent. I swam every day, played piano and loved books. I guess I had a fairly sheltered upbringing but I grew up loving life.<\/p><p>At 18 I went off to college to study chemical engineering and Japanese. I chose the College of William & Mary in Virginia, which oozed history. I decided to live on campus in a women-only residence hall. I threw myself into campus life, joining a band and a church youth group. <\/p><p>In the first week I met a guy. I thought he was amazing-looking, and luckily he had the talent to match. I wasn't naive but I was a romantic at heart. I thought you were lucky if you met the right prince. <\/p><p>He asked me out for dinner. It was pretty rare to eat off campus so I was really excited to go. We went to a fancy restaurant with candles and live music. The waiters spoke French, my date ordered in French, and I couldn't believe my good fortune. I felt I'd met the best guy in the whole campus.<\/p><div id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n    <div>\n        \n    <\/div>\n<\/div><p>After dinner I didn't want to go back to his room.

There was no, \"OK the door to your room has opened and you've turned on the green light for everything the guy might want.\"<\/p><p>On my ceiling I had the constellations of the night sky.

I was just thinking I have to get him to stop doing that, so I pushed him away gently.<\/p><p>He stopped and moved to the other side of room. I glanced into the mirror and saw him taking off his clothes and thought. \"Oh no.\" And then, \"Oh wow,\" because he was so handsome.<\/p><aside><div>\n<span><\/span><blockquote>In 1990, rape was still stranger rape - it was not about people you liked or you were dating<\/blockquote>\n<\/div><\/aside><p>I basically had a feminist epiphany all in one minute.

He must have weighed 185lbs (84kg). I'm much lighter at 105lbs (48kg). <\/p><p>He held my arms over my head with just one of his and was trying to get my dress off. I was afraid I wouldn't be able to get out from underneath him, and still I never thought about being raped.<\/p><p>In 1990, rape was still stranger rape. It was not about people you liked or you were dating. People said you could be raped by someone off the street, they said, \"Park where it's well lit, don't walk alone.\" I knew all those things. My dad gave me pepper spray when I went to college. I didn't wear it around my neck on a date, though.<\/p><p>I think no-one ever told this guy, \"No\".

I kept saying \"No,\" and \"Please get off.\" And he kept saying, \"Calm down, everything's going to be fine,\" and that was the moment when I lost my virginity against my will. <\/p><p>To have that special moment which I was saving for my wedding night squashed into a pink carpet on a cement floor in my room was jarring to my whole self, my whole soul.<\/p><p>The moment he left I didn't move.

They sent me home with a bottle of sleeping pills. I went to the dean's office and he said, \"You could ruin his life and you seem emotionally distraught, so you should go home and think carefully about this.\"<\/p><p>Then the guy started sending notes and leaving voicemails saying, \"Don't try to avoid me, I'll find you and speak to you, you cannot escape me, I am in love with you.\"<\/p><p>I finally broke down and told my parents. I said, \"Dad, I was raped.\" <\/p><p>He said, \"I'll drive down and get him,\" then asked where it happened. I think he envisaged a parking lot and I said, \"It happened in my room.\" Dad said, \"How did he get in, did he bust your locks?\" And I said, \"No, he's another student, and I invited him to hang out with me.\" <\/p><p>My dad said matter-of-factly, \"It would not have happened if you had not let him in your room, Katie,\" and then hung up the phone. So I was on my own.  <\/p><p>My friends and his friends arranged a meeting with my attacker to talk it through. Our friends were hoping that if we could patch things up, we could all be buddies again. <\/p><p>I met him in his building, in the lounge. I said: \"Did you hear me say 'No'?\" <\/p><p>He said: \"I heard your father is angry that you're not a virgin any more. I'll call him and tell him I'm a nice guy, and you're in excellent hands.\" And I said that wasn't the problem. <\/p><p>Then he said, \"You were a little stiff the first time round, and we need some more practice and then you'll enjoy yourself a lot better.\" Then he said - and I remember this bit particularly - \"It's always tough for the virgins.\" And that last comment was the one that snapped me. <\/p><p>At the end of that meeting, I had two choices. If I left the building and turned left, it would lead me back to my residence hall.

I told myself, \"You must at least try to help save the next 19 girls that go out with him, who will feel exactly how you feel now.\"<\/p><p>It was incredibly embarrassing at the campus police station. There were all sorts of questions about sex and what I was wearing.<\/p><aside><div>\n<span><\/span><blockquote>My attacker admitted I told him 'No' more than a dozen times<\/blockquote>\n<\/div><\/aside><p>I felt like a jerk for having him over to my room and when I admitted I let him pay for dinner, I felt that was one more thing I had done wrong.<\/p><p>They questioned him and our friends. They noted bruising and tearing and the fact I was no longer a virgin. I hadn't screamed but I had bitten a hole in my cheek.<\/p><p>In the end the District Attorney decided that we only had a 15% chance of winning the case as back then \"forcible rape\" meant I would have had to fight him off.<\/p><p>The last option open to me was to use the university disciplinary system. There was a handbook of policies that all students agreed to on enrolment. In 1990 it just said, \"You're not allowed to sexually assault someone.\"  <\/p><p>So they held the first ever sexual misconduct hearing at this, the second oldest college in the country.<\/p><p>The hearing took seven hours and finished at 2am. My accused brought two legal aides with him.  <\/p><p>My attacker admitted I told him \"No\" more than a dozen times. He said, \"Eventually she stopped saying 'No' and I knew I'd changed her mind.\"<\/p><p>The next day the dean called me to his office and told me I should feel safe. They'd found him responsible and he wasn't going to be allowed in my residence hall for the remainder of the semester.<\/p><p>But he said, \"You two make such a nice couple and he really likes you, so maybe you could get back together.\" <\/p><p>I was so furious I thought I'd write a letter to all the parents of the students at my college telling them what happened, saying, \"If you care about your children, you need to protest.\"<\/p><p>I had no money for postage so I sent the letter to the local newspaper. I convinced them to use my full name, as I felt people needed to know I was real. <\/p><p>Then the Associated Press picked it up and it caught on like wildfire.<\/p><p>I had calls from dozens of newspapers and talk shows. I hadn't intended for this to happen but they convince you to speak to them by saying, \"We have his side of the story, don't you want to defend yourself?\"<\/p><p>So being a white, upper-middle-class, Christian, straight-A student, I had the right resume at that moment in history for the discussion which went: \"Can a woman be attracted to a man, he buys dinner and they go home, does she still have the right to say 'No?'\"<\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Katie Koestner at her high school graduation\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/A948\/production\/_89863334_editkkgraudation.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    Katie Koestner at her high school graduation in 1990\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Time magazine even put me on their front cover the week that Rajiv Gandhi died. <\/p><p>Meanwhile I trained as a rape counsellor. I found there was one location on campus where lots of rapes were reported, so I set up a one-woman protest and handed out flyers saying, \"Do you want to go in, when three women were raped here last weekend?\"<\/p><p>No-one wanted to hear it, though. When news spread that HBO were making a film about my experience, 2,000 students signed a petition saying I lied. It was getting more and more difficult to walk around campus.<\/p><aside><div>\n<span><\/span><blockquote>The presumption was men who committed rape could never be well-educated, affluent or talented at sports<\/blockquote>\n<\/div><\/aside><p>It was especially shocking coming from women. People would say, \"You're devaluing my degree, people will only know our college for rape.\" And I'd say, \"Rape happens everywhere, it's the whole system that's flawed.\"<\/p><p>On talk shows I was always asked why I didn't try to fight him off, why I couldn't do something better. It was never, \"Why did he presume that he could have sex with you?\"<\/p><p>I was accused of doing a disservice to women, making us appear weak. <\/p><p>The presumption was men who committed rape could never be well-educated, affluent or talented at sports.<\/p><p>While I was still in college, I started going to high schools and telling young people about what happened to me to try to save them from going through what I had. Then I just felt like I couldn't stop and I've kept going these past 25 years.<\/p><p>You should see their tears. They hug you, they write notes, they tell their secrets and that is all worth it. Every time I make myself tell my story, there are 10, 20, 30 more stories that are told.<\/p><p>I tell young people that they are the generation that can change the conversation. It must be, \"I am never too important to ask for someone else's consent,\" and, \"I must always expect respect from everyone I am with,\" so expect respect and ask for consent. <\/p><p>In my case people called it \"date rape\" because I'd gone out to dinner. People stuck a descriptor in front of \"rape\", like there's \"date rape\" and \"real rape\".  <\/p><p>That shocked me - that somehow if you got dinner out of it, then it wasn't a bad rape. \"At least you had a nice meal.\"<\/p><p>I'm not going to say which is worse, being grabbed by a stranger off the road and you're lucky if you live, or being out with someone you think you can trust, who has all the makings of your Prince Charming and having them disrespect you completely. <\/p><p>If I had been raped on a street, then I'd have been afraid of strangers, but if you're raped by someone you know, then you're afraid of everyone.<\/p><p>For me the attack was just wrong. I didn't rate it, define it or judge it. I just thought that was wrong. No-one should ever go through what I did.<\/p><p><i>Katie Koestner was talking to Claire Bowes<\/i><\/p><p><i>Subscribe to the <\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/ssl.bbc.co.uk\/newsletters\/newsmagazine?ptrt=http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/magazine\">BBC News Magazine's email newsletter<\/a><i> to get articles sent to your inbox.<\/i><\/p>\n                                                                                                <\/div>\n"},"Last journey: The migrant who lost everything":{"link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/world-asia-36202843#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa","description":"The migrant who lost everything trying to reach Greece","content":"<div property=\"articleBody\" contentScore=\"5538\">\n                                                                                                    <figure><div>\n            <figure data-playable='{\"settings\":{\"counterName\":\"news.world.asia.story.36202843.page\",\"edition\":\"Domestic\",\"pageType\":\"eav2\",\"uniqueID\":\"36202843\",\"ui\":{\"locale\":{\"lang\":\"en-gb\"}},\"externalEmbedUrl\":\"http:\\\/\\\/www.bbc.co.uk\\\/news\\\/world-asia-36202843\\\/embed\",\"insideIframe\":false,\"statsObject\":[],\"playlistObject\":{\"title\":\"Afghan migrant Mohammed Nowrouz Noori spent days looking for the bodies of his wife and two children after they died on a failed crossing from Turkey to Greece.\",\"holdingImageURL\":null,\"guidance\":null,\"simulcast\":false,\"liveRewind\":false,\"embedRights\":\"blocked\",\"items\":[{\"vpid\":\"p03x0y5h\",\"live\":false,\"duration\":97,\"kind\":\"programme\"}],\"summary\":\"Afghan migrant Mohammed Nowrouz Noori spent days looking for the bodies of his wife and two children after they died on a failed crossing from Turkey to Greece.\"}},\"otherSettings\":{\"advertisingAllowed\":true,\"continuousPlayCfg\":{\"enabled\":false},\"isAutoplayOnForAudience\":false,\"unProcessedImageUrl\":\"http:\\\/\\\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\\\/news\\\/640\\\/cpsprodpb\\\/6991\\\/production\\\/_89852072_nowruzatcemeteryfive.jpg\"}}'><\/figure><\/div>\n    <figcaption><span>Media caption<\/span>Nowrouz spent days looking for the bodies of his wife and two children after they died on the crossing Greece<\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Hundreds of migrants face huge debts and a logistical nightmare to repatriate the bodies of loved ones who have died during perilous sea crossings to Europe.  <\/p><p>Compounding the trauma of personal loss they face a lonely battle to find and identify husbands, wives and children before trying to bring them home for burial. <\/p><h2>The survivor<\/h2><p>Mohammed Nowrouz Noori is an Afghan man in his late 30s but he is already a broken man. <\/p><p>In January this year he set off with his wife Nilufar, son Mohammad and baby daughter Nastaran from the Turkish coast heading for Greece.<\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Nowrouz at the grave of his wife Nilufar in Kabul\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/15C87\/production\/_89632298_nowruzseven.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    Nowrouz at the grave of his wife Nilufar in Kabul\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>\"When we were boarding my son said 'Dad I have prayed that we reach to other side safely',\" Nowrouz says as he recounts the tragedy at the family home back in Kabul.  <\/p><div id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n    <div>\n        \n    <\/div>\n<\/div><p>\"We could see lights from Greece.
