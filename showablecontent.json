The 5s is nearly three years old and Indian buyers, though price-conscious, have not shown much interest in buying old models.  <\/p><p>Apple, therefore, has a problem. Its newer models are expensive and its cheaper models are too old to be interesting for Indian buyers.<\/p><h2>Refurbished phones<\/h2><p>One answer is refurbished phones, which Apple sells in other markets. It calls them \"pre-owned and certified\", explaining that these are current models, often returned by a customer. These models go back to the factory to be tested and certified. They emerge with a new identity (an IMEI number) and warranty.<\/p><p>Analysts say this could be a winner for Apple because Indian buyers will be more willing to buy such phones at a discount.<\/p><p>Selling refurbished current models will increase Apple's share of the 15,000 to 30,000-rupee segment, which accounted for 5.6% of the smartphone market in the first quarter of 2016, according to CMR analyst Faisal Kawoosa. <\/p><p>\"With the brand equity of Apple, it can easily grab over 40% of this segment, almost doubling its sales,\" he says.<\/p><p>\"This could take Apple to selling four million units in 2016 in India.\"  <\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"An Indian woman talks on her mobile phone as she walks past the logo of the iPhone 4 during its launch by provider Aircel in Hyderabad on May 27, 2011.\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/776D\/production\/_89737503_50accb23-d0b7-41a3-8797-d63977393f52.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"600\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>Getty Images<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    Older iPhone models are cheaper, but their sale is low in India\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>There is a problem, though. <\/p><p>The government may not allow Apple to sell refurbished phones in India, citing concerns about \"dumping of old models\" and \"e-waste\". <\/p><p>Industry insiders say this appears to be a result of intense lobbying by rival handset vendors with the government to disallow Apple from selling refurbished phones.

Detaching easily from a surface was another challenge; if perching was the only goal, Mr Graule said, \"we could have put a little glue on top of the robot\".  <\/p><p>To solve these problems, the researchers designed a small, flat \"landing patch\" with an electrostatic charge that can be switched on and off. <\/p><p>When switched on, the patch acquires a negative charge that makes it stick to nearby, more positively charged surfaces.<\/p><p>You can experience a similar effect by \"rubbing a balloon on your hair then sticking it to a wall,\" explained principal investigator of the Harvard RoboBee project, Dr Robert Wood. And for the dismount, said Dr Wood, \"[we] simply remove power to the patch\". <\/p><p>What the team is most excited about though are the opportunities that such minuscule component parts promise for other applications.

We want our hands to be able to do more; that's why we have hammers. <\/p><p>VR allows us to go beyond the limitations of physical tools to do anything that can be computed. If you want to create a two-mile high tower made out of toothpicks, you can do it. <\/p><p>I did a series of 14 different environments; one where you felt like you were very high and had to look down: that was the first time people found this sense of vertigo within a virtual environment. I did a world where you look up towards the sky and see fireworks exploding; that's just magical. <\/p>                                                                                                    <p>I wanted to build a tool so people could use it. The best way to do that was to stay away from the consumer market because it really wasn't ready, and to go after industrial uses. <\/p><p>So my company created a viewing system that actually meets the specs of modern VR. <\/p><p>Because it had such high resolution, commercial users could use it to solve real problems. <\/p><p>Automobile companies used it for car design. Oil and gas industry used it to visualise data to figure out the right place to sink a well. <\/p><p>The next step was to make these cheap. Consumer VR up until then had a really narrow field of view; it was like looking through a tube of paper. Peripheral vision is really important for a visceral sense, and that's what people really react to. <\/p><p>To find a way to make it low cost and still retain that field of view, we harnessed the power of mobile phones - the screens, tracking and processing - and we figured out a lens design that was extremely inexpensive.<\/p><p>It's been really fun playing all these years, but there's something more important now, which is making it a space that allows us to harness our emotions, our desire to connect with people.<\/p><p>I'm worried by our current computer interfaces. I watch people walking around like zombies with cell phones in their hands, and I have to manoeuvre a mouse to fill out little boxes on web forms in a horribly frustrating way. I think VR will allow us to transcend this. <\/p><p>I don't worry so much about where VR is going, I worry about where we currently are.<\/p><hr><h2>Maria Korolov: Work, rest and play<\/h2><p><i>Maria Korolov is a technology journalist who has devoted her career to writing about virtual reality. <\/i><\/p><p>The biggest way [VR is changing the workplace] is training and simulations.

Google has been seeding elementary schools with over 100,000 virtual reality headsets and lesson plans. Kids are able to go on a virtual reality field trip to, say, the surface of the moon.<\/p><p>Gamers want something visceral. When you're riding a roller-coaster and you go down a hill, your stomach drops out: even though you know it's not real, your body reacts as if it's there. When I showed a shark simulation to people and they screamed, I laughed because, \"Ha ha, they're not real.\" Then I put it on and the shark came at me and I screamed, because it's a physical reaction. <\/p><p>The adult industry is jumping into this with everything they've got because it is so compelling. I have sampled it purely from a reviewer perspective, and it felt like you were in a locker room, and you don't know where to look because everyone's naked, and the lights are too bright, and they're interacting with you. This is going to be big. <\/p><p>The way the internet has changed the way we communicate information, virtual reality will change the way we communicate experiences. <\/p><p>If I wanted to show you what it's like to cook a meal, I could invite you to my virtual apartment and take you through a virtual cooking class. If I wanted to experience a walk in the woods with you, I could take you to my favourite virtual woods.<\/p><p>It will make the world even smaller than it is now.

I recently travelled to Iraq to interview former ISIS fighters \u2014people who just weeks ago had volunteered to be suicide bombers. <\/p><p>I learned that when aspiring fighters arrive at ISIS's headquarters in Raqqa, Syria, they are forced to give up two of their most prized possessions, their passport and their mobile phone \u2014 symbols of their physical and digital mobility.<\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"IS fighters in Raqqa in 2014\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/15824\/production\/_89700188_raqqa.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>AP<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    So-called Islamic State fighters have to give up their mobile phones in Raqqa\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The former fighters described life in the caliphate in stark contrast to the common ISIS narrative of a group of noble warriors fighting for Muslims' rights. The recruits couldn't speak freely, move freely, or use technology. <\/p><p>They were prisoners in every sense. Once the new joiners completed their six weeks of obligatory religious and military training, they got their phones back. <\/p><p>The defectors I spoke with were the lucky ones. They had contacts in a nearby military force who coordinated their escape. <\/p><p>Most people aren't so lucky. If my interviews are any indication, there are many young people who know immediately upon arrival in the caliphate that they have made a huge mistake and that they want to leave, but they don't know how. <\/p><p>They do, however, have access to a mobile phone and wi-fi. It would be a mistake not to exploit this opportunity to reach disaffected members of ISIS.<\/p><h2>'Fundamental right'<\/h2><p>Although these examples illustrate seemingly isolated cases of life under severe censorship or the deprivation of information, pro-democracy think tank Freedom House reports that, two thirds of the world faces some type of repression. <\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Computer keyboard\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/18380\/production\/_89700299_thinkstockphotos-489773763.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>Thinkstock<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    Some repressive governments are using the internet as a weapon\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>And more governments than ever are censoring information that is in the public's interest.<\/p><p>It's easy to take each of the above examples as isolated cases, or to make excuses for such oppression as the result of cultural differences.

In a report in February the committee, chaired by the former Labour Northern Ireland secretary Lord Murphy of Torfaen, called on the government to publish \"publish a fuller justification for each of the bulk powers\". <\/p><p>The committee highlighted three types of bulk powers in the bill for the security and intelligence agencies: the bulk interception of data, bulk acquisition of communications data and bulk interference with equipment.<\/p><p>The independent review will be established under David Anderson once he has selected two experts with security clearance to support him on technical and legal issues. He will report by the summer in time for the committee stage of the bill in the House of Lords.<\/p><h2>'Encouraging'<\/h2><p>Mr Burnham described the home secretary's letter as \"extremely encouraging\" but made clear the government needs to go further to win Labour support. The shadow home secretary was due to tell MPs in the commons debate on the Queen's speech: \"A few weeks ago, I wrote to the Home Secretary setting out seven areas where we want to see significant movement.<\/p><p>\"Yesterday the Home Secretary wrote to me on two of these issues and I have to say I found her letter extremely encouraging. <\/p><p>\"Her commitment to an independent review of the case for bulk powers is a major concession but the right thing to do and something which will build trust in this process.\"<\/p><p>Mr Burnham welcomed a second concession in the home secretary's letter - amending the bill to make clear that the security and intelligence agencies cannot use the powers to monitor legitimate trade union activity. The government believes that the agencies are not allowed to carry out such investigations.<\/p><p>But the home secretary is happy to amend the bill to reassure her Labour opposite number who supports the Shrewsbury 24 campaign which is pushing for the quashing of the convictions from the 1970s of construction worker pickets, including the actor Ricky Tomlinson.

it voted for Brexit. <\/p><p>However, it said this could be overshadowed by the negative impact on the UK economy, with a 0.6% fall in national income offsetting the benefits. <\/p><p>Mr Johnson said: \"Leaving the EU would give us an immediate \u00a38bn boost to the public finances, but the overwhelming consensus is that the economy would be smaller than otherwise following Brexit.<\/p><p>\"If the economy is just a few percentage points smaller than it otherwise would have been, we will be a bit worse off.\" <\/p><hr><h2>Analysis by Kamal Ahmed, BBC economics editor<\/h2><p>The IFS's report on the impact on the public finances of Brexit is different from the myriad of economic reports flowing from organisations as diverse as the International Monetary Fund and Economists for Brexit.<\/p><p>Rather than do its own economic modelling, the IFS has taken the mid-point of most of the major reports on the possible referendum impact and built its analysis from that.<\/p><p>It judges that mid-point to be closest to the National Institute of Economic and Social Research study which suggested that Brexit could leave the UK economy between 2% and 3.5% smaller than under a remain scenario.<\/p><p>From that the IFS uses a simple economic model that suggests that for every 1% decline in GDP, the government needs to raise an extra \u00a314bn due to lower tax receipts.<\/p><p>Of course, if the economic impact of Brexit is - in the long run - positive, as some economists argue, then the impact on the public finances would also be positive.<\/p><hr><p>The UK \"could perfectly reasonably decide that we are willing to pay a bit of a price for leaving the EU and regaining some sovereignty and control over immigration and so on\", Mr Johnson said. <\/p><p>\"That there would be some price though, I think is now almost beyond doubt.\"<\/p><p>But Vote Leave's John Redwood said the IFS was in the \"cosy establishment\" and the UK was better off out of the EU.<\/p><p>Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he disputed the forecasts used in the report, and said savings made from quitting the EU would mean austerity would not be needed.<\/p><p>But on Twitter Andrew Lilico, the chairman of Vote Leave-affiliated Economists for Britain, <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/andrew_lilico\/status\/735363727415992321\">distanced himself from the criticisms of what he called the Leave campaign's \"propaganda arm\"<\/a>.<\/p><p>Patrick Minford, co-chairman of a separate group, Economists for Brexit, said that the IFS analysis acknowledged that the free trade approach recommended by his organisation \"would be the best option for the UK following an exit from the EU\".<\/p><p>Gerard Lyons, his co-chairman, added: \"The UK needs to break away from the short-termism and the groupthink that had dominated UK policy making and embrace Brexit as this is the best way to position the economy for longer-term future growth.\"<\/p><ul><li>\n<a

While many people remember 1967 for the \"Summer of Love\" and the way it embraced hippie looks, this is, again, targeting \"everywoman\", the people who worked in offices, shops and so on for whom patched jeans or a kaftan were dangerously subversive! But there is innovation going on here. Twiggy (left) was the model of the moment with a haircut and body shape that was very untraditional. It set a template for M&S's marketing of its products that was very directional, even if the fashion itself was mainstream.<\/p><h2>1972<\/h2><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Men's suit, Autumn Winter 1972\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/205E\/production\/_89768280_9.autumnwinter1972-menssuits.jpg\" data-width=\"624\" data-height=\"950\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>The Marks & Spencer Company Archive<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n        <\/figure><p>Given that this was the year of David Bowie, Glam Rock, Led Zeppelin and the like, this is very conservative up to a point and represents a certain kind of customer.

M&S has always been at the forefront of using new materials, and styles like this suit, shirt and tie would most likely have had easy-care features using advanced synthetic materials in conjunction with natural fibres.<\/p><h2>1983<\/h2><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Spring 1983 collection\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/476E\/production\/_89768281_spring1983.jpg\" data-width=\"624\" data-height=\"800\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>The Marks & Spencer Company Archive<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n        <\/figure><p>M&S was riding high in 1983 and while it was never a fashion beacon, it was still attracting a good cross-section of the population. This look is very mainstream - the Princess Diana-influenced flat shoes, the \"mini\" skirt that's not too short, the Dexy's Midnight Runners-style dungarees that by now had been around for a few years so no longer seemed unusual. This would have appealed to the woman in the street who wanted to tap into fashion trends very gently with clothes that she knew were good quality. <\/p>                                                                                                    <p>But it wouldn't really have appealed to fashion forward customers - they were too busy wearing Bodymap and Jean Paul Gaultier. Not that M&S couldn't have done high fashion. The chain had some superb designers at this time but its customer didn't want to be challenged, they wanted clothes that looked and felt good and that they knew would work for their lives.<\/p><h2>1996<\/h2><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Cardigan, January 1996\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/6E7E\/production\/_89768282_cardigan,jan1996.jpg\" data-width=\"624\" data-height=\"900\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>The Marks & Spencer Company Archive<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n        <\/figure><p>This was just a few years before M&S faced a perfect storm as fast fashion began to undermine its dominance. I think by the 90s it was quite complacent as it knew it had a devoted mainstream following who weren't about to defect to anything else on the High Street. This look sums that up. It's nice enough but given that a whole year earlier fashion had been shaken up by Tom Ford's 70s-influenced styling at Gucci and that Prada was starting to get into high gear, it's really very dull! <\/p><p>It's worth pointing out, though, that at the same time M&S was powering ahead in its food business and was innovating all over the place in terns of customer service, recipes and ingredients. That spirit of innovation didn't filter through to fashion, apart from in materials where it was an early user of innovative stretch fabrics. But that's because its typical customer at the time didn't want innovation. She might have wanted to experiment in the kitchen, but not with her wardrobe!<\/p><h2>2006<\/h2><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"(L-R) Erin O'Connor, Elizabeth Jagger and Laura Bailey pose for a photograph as they launch a new campaign for Marks and Spencer on September 12, 2006\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/BC9E\/production\/_89768284_gettyimages-71858839.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"700\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>Getty Images<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n        <\/figure><p>This was the height of M&S's obsession with celebrity models and the looks here reflect its fashion approach at the time.

It has to reach mainstream consumers. The recent Alexa Chung collection was an interesting one. Personally I wasn't overly-impressed, but the social media chatter around it was very positive and certain items seemed to sell out online very fast. While it was billed as being an \"archive\" collection, it was really a mix of straight replications and re-interpretations (like this dress that was based on a 1960s original). <\/p><p>I'm interested to see what they do with Alexa next. M&S really needs to turn its clothing offer around as it's so important to it. It may be doing well in foods but clothing is a higher-margin business so is crucial. It has a big challenge because its business model of a giant single-brand operation targeting so many different customers is one that struggles in the modern world where online stores, ultra-fast fashion and luxury are the headline-grabbers.<\/p><p><i>Sandra Halliday is a fashion expert and founder of the blog <\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/trendwalk.net\/\">trendwalk.net<\/a><\/p>\n                                                                                                <\/div>\n"},"Pisa tests for 21st Century 'global skills'":{"link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-36343602#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa","description":"The next Pisa tests will check 'global skills'","content":"<div property=\"articleBody\" contentScore=\"4755\">\n                                                                                                    <figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Global skills\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/9220\/production\/_89780473_global.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>Thinkstock<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    The next round of international Pisa tests will test the skills needed to live and work alongside people of different cultures\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p><strong>Pisa tests, an international standard for comparing education systems around the world, could include a new measurement of global skills in the next round of tests in 2018.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>The OECD, which runs the tests in maths, reading and science, is considering adding another test which would look at how well pupils can navigate an increasingly diverse world, with an awareness of different cultures and beliefs.<\/strong><\/p><p><strong>The OECD's education director Andreas Schleicher explains why there is such a need for new rankings to show young people's competence in a world where globalisation is a powerful economic, political and cultural force.<\/strong><\/p><p>Education leaders around the world are increasingly talking about the need to teach \"global competences\" as a way of addressing the challenges of globalisation.<\/p><p>It was one of the key topics at this month's meeting of education ministers from the G7 group of leading industrial countries, held in Japan.<\/p><div id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n    <div>\n        \n    <\/div>\n<\/div><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"digital economy\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/113C4\/production\/_89769507_032961862.jpg\" data-width=\"624\" data-height=\"351\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>Reuters<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    The digital economy will need workers who can work in different cultures\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Globalisation can mean different things to different people.

How can receiving countries integrate diverse groups of people and avoid rising extremism and fundamentalism?<\/li>\n<li>Sustainability: Delivering on the UN Sustainable Development Goals is a priority in the international community. Development that meets the needs of the present, without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs, is more relevant than ever before, in the face of environmental degradation, climate change, overconsumption and population growth.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>Today, all three principles are at risk.

But if you're paying for a \"vice product\" like cookies, cakes and pies you are acting on a visceral impulse. <\/p><p>The pain of paying can't be justified so easily. So if you're using a plastic card you can mitigate that pain and you're more likely to go ahead and buy.<\/p><p>Interestingly the researchers also found that \"tightwads\" who are generally reluctant to spend, were more susceptible to the soothing influence of paying with a card, compared to the \"spendthrifts\" who part with money more easily in the first place. <\/p><p>Given that most of us, when faced with a doughnut, can experience difficulties with \"impulse control\" this information could prove useful.<\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Jean-Robert Kamdoum\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/61C3\/production\/_89772052_20160523_091131-1.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    When he ran a test, Jean-Robert Kamdoum found paying with contactless made him spend more than usual\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Steve Peters is author of The Chimp Paradox, a book examining how our rational, long-term decision-making tries to constrain our desire for immediate gratification.<\/p><p>\"One of the systems works very impulsively. By nature the contactless payments favours that system. Whereas the cash in your hand makes you act rationally. It favours the system where you're going to think through the consequences of your action.\" <\/p><p>So could contactless payments - waving a card or a phone briefly over a reader - further weaken our ability to resist the treats?<\/p><p>Claudia Hammond, author of a new book, Mind over Money, and a presenter on BBC radio, says it's too soon to judge the impact of contactless per se, but she believes it's likely to follow a similar pattern.<\/p><p>\"I think there is something that feels even more unreal about contactless payment,\" she says.<\/p><p>\"No-one has measured that yet, but I would say it will divorce the pain of paying from the actual transaction again.\" <\/p><p>So it could well make people spend more, not just on food but on all sorts of things.<\/p><p>\"People don't remember how much they paid when it's on a card.

of the warnings they receive than is necessary, the research suggests.<\/p><p>It said: \"Whilst some children needed to be protected, there is little evidence to support this scale of statutory

father was yelling at his children and might be taking drugs.<\/p><p>\"Many of these lead to nothing,\" he said.<\/p><p>\"We have this mantra that says it's everybody's job to safeguard children but what we are doing doesn't actually safeguard children. <\/p><p>\"Creating these huge numbers of referrals of concern is like creating a huge, extra big haystack in which we are trying to find the

still feel that you are under threat.\"<\/p><p>A Department for Education spokesperson said: \"Ensuring children are safe and well looked after is our top priority - where there are concerns about a

institutions, more than nine out of 10 report that a no to low impact is anticipated,\" said the spokesman. <\/p><p>\"We would like to see the UCU consulting its members on the final offer.\"<\/p><p>The employers say the offer is \"at, and, for some, beyond, a limit of affordability for higher education institutions and the very best offer that will be available this year\". <\/p><p>They maintain the weighting of the offer means the worst paid university staff will get a rise of more than 5%. <\/p><p>They say they have also offered talks on zero-hours contracts and on improving lower pay for female academics.  <\/p><h2>Autumn term<\/h2><p>But UCU says it rejected the 1.1% offer as it was only a marginal improvement on the original 1% on which it had balloted

correspondent<\/strong><\/p><p>Insiders have been telling me that while improvements have been made to Birmingham children's services, the department still struggles to retain staff and therefore relies heavily on agency workers. <\/p><p>They also say that social workers can still be dealing with between 20 and 30 individual cases, even though a maximum of 15 is recommended. <\/p><p>Critics of the council have been calling for a change along these lines for years, but it's unlikely that the new voluntary trust, however it is set up, will be a panacea for the city's problems. <\/p><p>Birmingham's central belt is one of the most deprived areas in the country and the city's population is rapidly growing. <\/p><p>Whoever takes charge will have to address recruitment and morale as a matter of urgency. <\/p><hr><p>Professor Ray Jones, who has advised councils on social services, said if there was \"a lot of work to do and not enough people to do the work, that'll be the same in the trust as anywhere else\". <\/p><p>An NSPCC spokesman said: \"Concerted efforts must now be made to improve staff retention rates and - most importantly of all - ensure the most vulnerable members of society are protected.\"<\/p><p>Brigid Jones, cabinet member for Children's Services at the city council, said it was \"a voluntary move\", adding: \"We will retain control of design, delivery, and the trust itself\".<\/p><p>\"Our caseloads are the lowest that they've been: they're 15 now on average, they were around 30 on average when I started,\" said Ms Jones.<\/p><p>\"We've got our staff turnover down from around a third to around a quarter. And the number of agency social workers has come down significantly as well. <\/p><p>\"What we need to do now is find a way to keep that improvement going. And we think that by going into some sort of trust arrangement, we can do that in the best way.\"<\/p><p>Alison Holt, BBC social affairs correspondent, said the announcement was brought forward because of a Channel 4 Dispatches programme to be broadcast this week.<\/p><p>She said: \"Similar children's trusts have been established to run services in places where there have been problems such as Doncaster and Slough.<\/p><p>\"They often rely on groups of experts, charities and high-performing local authorities to provide support.\"<\/p><p>Perry Barr MP, Khalid Mahmood, said he welcomed the news that a trust would make key decisions, but said there were still \"huge issues\" around how it would be staffed, managed and resourced.<\/p><hr><h2>Undercover TV investigation<\/h2><ul><li>A spokeswoman from Dispatches said its undercover investigation revealed a \"troubling picture of chaos, low staff morale, confused decision-making and overstretched colleagues struggling to cope\"<\/li>\n<li>Key findings included concern over cases \"where children could be at risk of sexual or physical abuse are not being handled properly\" and social workers \"not receiving appropriate supervision\" and wanting to quit<\/li>\n<li>One junior social worker resigned after \"being forced to 'beg' for help from managers\"<\/li>\n<li>There was confusion over how cases should be categorised.

procedures to protect these children from criminalisation. <\/p><p>Lord Laming's report says half of children in custody in England and Wales have, at some time, been in care.<\/p><p>The government said the safety and well-being of children was \"paramount\".<\/p><p>The report, In Care, Out of Trouble, describes how looked-after children are often prosecuted for challenging behaviour that would normally be dealt with in the family home.<\/p><div id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n    <div>\n        \n    <\/div>\n<\/div><h2>'Kicking doors'<\/h2><p>A recently retired magistrate gave examples to the review of young people appearing in court for \"kicking doors, squirting shower gel on carpets, or using abusive language to staff\".<\/p><p>She said she \"often raised concerns about the way trivial incidents in children's homes resulted in police call-outs and prosecutions in circumstances where ordinary parents would never resort to criminalising their own children\".<\/p><p>Even though the Crown Prosecution Service and the local authority reassured her that all cases were reviewed according to special protocols designed to weed out minor misdemeanours, the children kept on appearing, she said.<\/p>                                                                                                    <p>The report says: \"This is a national problem which central and local government, and local criminal justice agencies, can and must do more to address.<\/p><p>\"Reductions in the rate at which children in care are criminalised will not happen by accident.\"<\/p><p>A government spokesman said: \"The rules are clear that no child living in a children's home should be criminalised for behaviour that would not concern the police if it happened in a family home.<\/p><p> \"While youth crime is down, we recognise that reoffending rates are too high and that the care and supervision of young offenders in custody is not good enough.\"<\/p><h2>Criminal record<\/h2><p>The spokesman added that a review had been ordered into the youth justice system and was due to come back in the summer with recommendations for improvements in care.<\/p><p>The report comes a week after David Cameron pledged that those leaving care would be given \"far more effective support\", with the introduction of a care leavers' covenant.<\/p><p>It calls for the charge to be taken forward at the very highest level, with the Cabinet forming a sub-committee charged with protecting children and young people in care from criminalisation.<\/p><p>The committee should then draw up cross-departmental agreements, which would require local authorities, police and other agencies to set targets locally to reduce the prosecution of these vulnerable and often traumatised youngsters.<\/p><p>Low-level criminal behaviour should not be recorded as a crime but should instead lead to a referral to a welfare agency, the report says.<\/p><p>Lord Laming said: \"As soon as the police are called, it's a criminal record. It's all part of the criminalisation of them.<\/p><p>\"We don't need to do that - it's quite avoidable but to avoid it we need leadership, imagination, direction and determination.\"<\/p><p>Lord Laming also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that some teenagers did \"dreadful things\" and, in such cases, should be dealt with by the justice system.<\/p><p>\"But that is altogether different from the police being called in circumstances that in a normal family, they would be dealt with within the family.\" <\/p><h2>Information sharing<\/h2><p>The report acknowledges there is already

evacuated as a precaution, meaning some GCSE, A-level and Higher exams had to be abandoned.<\/p><p>The BBC News website answers some of the key questions on the issue.<\/p><h2>Is there any bomb alert guidance for schools?<\/h2><p>Yes. There is a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jcq.org.uk\/exams-office\/ice---instructions-for-conducting-examinations\/instructions-for-conducting-examinations-2015-2016\">procedure for schools<\/a> to follow in the event of an emergency such as a fire or bomb alert during public examinations. <\/p><p>This is set out by the Joint Council for Qualifications, which represent the seven largest UK exam providers.<\/p><div id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n    <div>\n        \n    <\/div>\n<\/div><h2>What should schools do then?<\/h2><p>Exam invigilators are advised to stop candidates from writing, collect the attendance register (in order to ensure all candidates are present) and evacuate the examination room.<\/p><p>Students should be told to leave all question papers and scripts in the exam room and must leave the exam hall in silence.<\/p><p>Staff must make sure that the candidates are supervised as closely as possible while they are out of the exam hall, to make sure there is no discussion about the examination.<\/p>                                                                                                    <p>Invigilators should make a note of the time of the interruption and how long it lasted and allow the candidates the full working time set for the examination.<\/p><p>The guidance says if there are only a few candidates, schools should consider the possibility of taking the candidates (with question papers and scripts) to another place to finish the examination.<\/p><p>Schools have to make a full report of the incident and of the action taken and send this to the relevant exam board.<\/p><h2>What about students' results?<\/h2><p>Students whose public exams were disrupted can rest assured that the situation will be fed back to the examiners. Schools will document how the exams were affected and send this to the exam boards. The boards will make any adjustments as they see fit, on a case-by-case basis.<\/p><p>A spokeswoman for the AQA exam board said: \"We need to look at each case on an individual basis because there are a range of ways in which students might have been affected - they might have taken all, part or none of the exam, or been affected by the incident in different ways. <\/p><p>\"Once we know the full circumstances from the schools, we can decide on the best course of action. In the meantime, our message to students is not to worry and to concentrate on the exams they've got coming up.\" <\/p><h2>What happened in schools following Monday's calls?<\/h2><p>It is not yet clear exactly how many schools received a hoax call and how each individual school dealt with it. It is thought some schools dismissed the caller as a hoax, while others implemented an evacuation.<\/p><p>For approximately 240 GCSE and A-level candidates at Canterbury Academy in Kent, the hoax call meant their exams had to be interrupted.<\/p><p>Head teacher Phil Karnavas said  a thorough police search of his large school took three and a half hours to complete, meaning the exams could not be resumed.  <\/p><p>Mr Karnavas said students, who were sitting a mixture of GCSE English, A-level English, A-level product design and A-level textiles, would not have the option to re-sit the disrupted exams.<\/p><p>He told the BBC: \"What will happen now is is the work they managed to complete in the exam will be taken into account, as will other parts of their examination - other papers - and if there was any controlled assessment or coursework, that will be taken into account.  <\/p><p>\"Special consideration will be launched and an aggregate grade will be awarded.\"<\/p><h2>What is special consideration?<\/h2><p>Special consideration is a post-exam adjustment to a candidate's mark or grade on the part of exam boards.<\/p><p>It is used to in circumstances where temporary illness, temporary injury or other indisposition at the time of the exam, could have had an effect on a candidate's ability to take an exam or demonstrate his or her normal level of attainment.<\/p><p>Schools which were evacuated mid-way through exams on Monday would have grounds to apply for special consideration for their students.<\/p><h2>What are the police doing about these incidents? <\/h2><p>The police are currently investigating the spate of hoax calls to UK schools on Monday.<\/p><p>Officers say there is no information at this stage to suggest the incidents are terrorist-related, however enquiries are continuing to establish the facts. <\/p><p>A spokeswoman for the  National Police Chiefs' Council  said: \"Forces are working together to investigate who is responsible and whether incidents are linked.  At this point, there is nothing to link these with a spate of similar calls earlier this year but this has not been ruled out.  <\/p><p>\"Police take hoaxes extremely seriously. They divert police resources and cause disruption and alarm to the public.\"<\/p><h2>What should pupils and parents do?<\/h2><p>The best thing pupils and parents can do is to stay calm and try not to let the incident distract them from the rest of the exams.<\/p><p>If they have any concerns, they should raise them with senior staff at the school.<\/p><h2>What does the government say?<\/h2><p>The Department for Education, which oversees schools in England, says in the event of a call like those on Monday, schools should - where possible - seek alternative venues for students to sit their exams.<\/p><p>It says staff should alert the exam boards as soon as possible and also make sure pupils and their parents are kept updated.<\/p><h2>I may have some information relating to these hoaxes.

guidance which tightened up the regulations in 2013, limiting head teachers on whether they could authorise holiday in term-time and opening the way to the mass fining of parents. <\/p><p>The Jon

They beat St John's College, Oxford, by 215 points to 30.<\/p><p>And yet there's no set route to appearing on the programme. A spokeswoman for ITV Studios, which produces it for BBC Two, says each university has its own team selection process. <\/p><p>Some of these are much more rigorous than others. Many student union presidents \"pick themselves and three of their mates\", <a href=\"http:\/\/www.blanchflower.org\/uc\/faq_applying.html\">writes<\/a> Sean Blanchflower, who won the competition in 1995 as part of the Trinity College, Cambridge, team.<\/p><p>Others organise some kind of selection quiz. The journalist Flora Watkins, who represented Edinburgh University in 1999, didn't face much competition when she arrived at the appointed time. \"There may only have been the four of us who ended up on the programme,\" she recalls.<\/p><div id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n    <div>\n        \n    <\/div>\n<\/div><p>But elsewhere it's far more competitive. Manchester University - whose four titles make it the joint highest series winners along with Magdalen College, Oxford - has a famously rigorous recruitment process managed by Stephen Pearson, a member of the library staff <a href=\"http:\/\/www.telegraph.co.uk\/culture\/tvandradio\/10020736\/Alex-Ferguson-of-University-Challenge-lives-for-the-buzz.html\">nicknamed<\/a> \"the Alex Ferguson of University Challenge\".<\/p><p>Pearson sets the approximately 150 students who apply to represent Manchester each year a 100-question general knowledge written test.

Contestants have to achieve a baseline mark in a test paper set by producers (filling it in, Watkins' strategy was that \"the answer to any given question would be either Churchill or Beethoven\") and demonstrate a solid level of knowledge in an interview session. <\/p><p>Before going on air, it's advisable to start practising buzzer technique. Watkins says she bitterly regrets not having done this, as her side was knocked out by a Peterhouse team with sharper reaction times. In the run-up to the Manchester team's trip to the studios, Pearson organises weekly \"friendly\" quizzes for his charges against alumni of the programme.<\/p><p>There are different views on how best to prepare on the day. Former Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind has attributed his Edinburgh side's first-round victory to how \"relaxed\" they became in the pub beforehand. Novelist Sebastian Faulks, however, who drank three bottles of barley wine before appearing on the quiz and smoked Players Number 6 throughout, was less enamoured of the experience. \"When my parents watched the programme, they were appalled\", he <a href=\"http:\/\/www.dailymail.co.uk\/tvshowbiz\/article-1101701\/Fingers-Buzzers-As-BBC2-devotes-night-homage-University-Challenge-eccentric-quiz-addictive.html#ixzz46Gu9a9bP\">remembered<\/a>.<\/p><p>Perhaps the most controversial aspect of the selection process is the fact that Oxford and Cambridge enter individual colleges to the contest, while other institutions compete on a university-wide basis. In 1975 the Manchester team (which included the future Times columnist David Aaronovitch) protested against this state of affairs by answering \"Trotsky\", \"Lenin\", \"Karl Marx\" or \"Che Guevara\" to every question.<\/p><p>It's a point of contention whether this helps or impedes Oxbridge. Critics say it gives each student at the elite institutions a better chance of getting on the show.

If someone back then had advised me of the actual facts, I probably would have turned up to at least one.\" <\/p><p>The band's refusal to play the industry game meant they could focus on making music. They released five albums in six years, with singles Dreaming Of You, Pass It On and In The Morning becoming major hits.<\/p><p>\"We were discouraged from releasing that many albums,\" says Power. \"We wanted to do more. Major labels don't want you to do that.\"<\/p><p>In fact, they have hours of unreleased material - Power mentions \"a concept album about an otter recorded in a \u00a31,500-a-day studio\" - but after 2010's Butterfly House, their first album without guitarist Bill Ryder-Jones, they were \"bereft of ideas\".<\/p><h2>Streaming boost<\/h2><p>They announced an indefinite hiatus, during which Power released two books of poetry; while Skelly recorded a solo album and started producing other bands, including BBC Sound of 2016 finalists Blossoms.<\/p><p>More importantly, Skelly dug out the sessions of a \"lost\" Coral album - 2006's The Curse Of Love - and polished them off for a full release. <\/p><p>\"It had no promotion at all,\" says Power, \"but the reaction was so good\" it became the catalyst for the band's revival.<\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"The Coral\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/1E1C\/production\/_89780770_5dce2da3-8b2f-4db4-b82b-410119079280.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    James Skelly: \"It's not a nostalgia thing.

Once we'd released it, I wrote the whole new album.\"<\/p><p>Distance Inbetween is inspired by the graphic novels of Alan Moore, the photography of Gregory Crewdson and even box set behemoth Mad Men - all of which expose the horror lurking beneath the \"normality\" of suburbia.<\/p><p>\"It's all churches and old people's homes around here,\" says Power. \"The image of something horrific or supernatural within that landscape is one of the things I find most powerful.\"<\/p><p>The album has seen The Coral's reputation restored, not to mention their confidence.<\/p><p>\"We're much more certain and much more focused now,\" says Power. \"In the middle period, we were really unsure with what we were doing. Being best mates was the only thing that bound us together. Morseo, it helped us survive.\"<\/p><p>Distance Inbetween became the band's eighth album to reach the top 20 in March. It even topped the vinyl charts, much to the band's delight.<\/p><p>\"I think it says something about the audience that they're willing to get behind us, and they genuinely care about the band,\" says Power. \"They enjoy the artwork and how we present it as a full thing.\"<\/p><p>But the band don't want to be seen as relics, constantly harking back to a \"golden era\" when fans actually bought records.<\/p><p>\"I don't mind what way people listen to music,\" protests Skelly. \"For kids now, streaming is the way they listen to music.

Yet dance had more or less disappeared and Warchus was keen to revive the tradition.  <\/p>                                                                                                    <p>McOnie says he's been waiting since childhood for someone to make the kind of offer the Old Vic has made.   <\/p><p>\"Slightly naively I said to Matthew I would come up with three titles we could choose from.  But after I went home I found myself thinking more and more about Jekyll & Hyde as an option.  It's about physical transformation so I thought it could work well for dance.<\/p><p>\"But initially I told myself no it just won't work.  Obviously when Stevenson wrote the book in the Victorian era no one knew the twist - that Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde turn out to be two sides of the same man.  But that big reveal is lost to us - all the films and the spoofs mean audiences know what's coming.<\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Tim Hodges in Jekyll & Hyde\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/11786\/production\/_89785517_20709cf5-c13e-48ab-87e6-74ca9cb3823e.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"600\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>Manuel Harlan <\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    Tim Hodges, who plays Mr Hyde, says the audience needs to ask: 'When you see blood on a character is that real blood or just something Hyde sees in his mind's eye?'\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>\"But somehow thinking about how impossible it all was made it more tempting.  When I came back to Matthew it was the only idea I offered and fortunately he said yes.\"<\/p><p>The Old Vic's current interior dates from the 1870s so it might appear the perfect home for a classic Victorian tale. McOnie struggled with that as a plan but finally dropped it.  <\/p><p>\"I just couldn't find a voice for the Victorian age which interested me so the show is loosely set in the 1950s.  It was a decade when there was a lot of pretence, which is perfect.  Also I knew that part of the show's aesthetic was going to echo all those brilliant old MGM musicals with Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly which I love.\"<\/p><p>Grant Olding's score divides into two.  The dance numbers for Jekyll and his romantic interest Dahlia feel like something Harold Arlen or Jule Styne might have written 60 years ago - McOnie says they're a bit like songs without lyrics. <\/p><p>\"But for Hyde's big dance numbers there's a more contemporary feel - a bluesy White Stripes sort of sound.  I think the contrast works well as the story gets darker.\"<\/p><p>Collins and Hodges have talked a lot about the relationship and the differences between their characters.  Hodges says audiences have to make basic decisions about what the story actually is. <\/p><p>\"For me the American Psycho parallel is pretty important.  Are the dark things which my character Hyde does - and the show does get pretty gory - really just fantasy?  When you see blood on a character is that real blood or just something Hyde sees in his mind's eye?  I'm not sure we ever offer the audience easy answers.\"<\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Jekyll & Hyde\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/13964\/production\/_89782208_danielcollins-drjekyllandrachelmuldoon-dahlia,jekyll-hydeattheoldvic.photobymanuelharlan-3.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>Manuel Harlan <\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    Choreographer Drew McOnie says he has become 'really involved' with his show\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Collins says the relationship makes him think of Tyler Durden in Fight Club.  \"So when my character has spent time as Hyde it's like when you've had a really massive night out and you're not really sure what's gone on.\"<\/p><p>Hodges says another influence has been thinking about the TV series Dexter. \"There you've got a central character who does awful things yet the audience has to feel sympathy for him. <\/p><p>\"But in our show it's complex because they're two separate characters.  Though that brings you back to the big question - are they two people or one man with a wild and dangerous imagination?\"<\/p><p> Hodges became a father at the weekend so he missed the first two performances.  <\/p><p>\"It's a show you get really involved with so - despite the lack of sleep - I'm relishing the rest of the run.  <\/p><p>\"The rhythms of the evening are different for me and Danny: I have fewer scenes but they get very intense as the violence kicks in.

In November he'll direct and choreograph a stage version of the film Strictly Ballroom at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in Leeds.<\/p><p>\"But for now I'm concentrating on Jekyll & Hyde.

GPs have been paid to reduce their use of antibiotics. <\/p><p>Local health bosses were given extra money by NHS England to get prescribing down and they have used this to incentivise doctors. Different arrangements were made in different areas, but some GP practices received in excess of \u00a320,000 for hitting the targets. Next year the targets have been extended to 4% for overall use and 20% for broad spectrum antibiotics. <\/p><p>In the NHS money, it seems, talks - but if it helps tackle what experts have described as a \"greater threat than cancer\" nobody will be complaining.  <\/p><hr><p>Reducing unnecessary prescribing saves the NHS money in drug costs.<\/p><p>The figures show GPs have overshot the targets.

years ago, was said to have approved of the plan.<\/p><p>The mother lost a High Court case last year but was subsequently granted permission to challenge the decision.<\/p><p>The latest round of the case is being heard at the Court of Appeal in London, before a panel of three judges. <\/p><div id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n    <div>\n        \n    <\/div>\n<\/div><h2>'Natural sympathy'<\/h2><p>The UK fertility regulator, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA), said, in 2014, the daughter's eggs could not be released from storage in London because she had not given her full written consent before she had died, from bowel cancer at the age of 28. <\/p><p>But, in the latest legal proceedings, lawyers acting for the mother told the judges she wanted to fulfil her daughter's wishes to carry a child created from her frozen eggs and \"raise that child\".<\/p><p>Jenni Richards QC added the eggs would \"simply be allowed to perish\" if the court did not rule in her favour. <\/p>                                                                                                    <p>Meanwhile, Catherine Callaghan, appearing for the HFEA, said in a written argument before the court: \"It is natural to feel sympathy for the appellants' loss and for their wish to keep their daughter's memory alive by trying to conceive a child using their daughter's eggs.\"<\/p><p>But it was not the court's role to decide whether it would have permitted the mother to undergo fertility treatment using her daughter's eggs. <\/p><p>Ms Callaghan added: \"Rather its role is to determine whether Mr Justice Ouseley erred in concluding that the HFEA's statutory approvals committee acted lawfully and rationally in exercising its broad discretion to refuse to authorise export of the frozen eggs to a treatment centre in New York for use in the way proposed.\" <\/p><h2>'Required consent'<\/h2><p>During earlier High Court proceedings in June 2015, the court was told her daughter was desperate to have children and had asked her mother to \"carry my babies\".<\/p><p>Lawyers acting for the mother and her 59-year-old husband told Mr Justice Ouseley the daughter would have been \"devastated\" if she had known her eggs could not be used.<\/p><p>But the judge ruled that the HFEA was entitled to find the daughter had not given \"the required consent\" and said there had been no breach of the family's human rights.<\/p><p>Although she consented for her eggs to be stored for use after her death, she did not fill in a separate form outlining how she wished them to be used. <\/p><p>He said he was dismissing the case \"conscious of the additional distress which this will bring to the claimants, whose aim has been to honour their daughter's dying wish\".<\/p><p>It was thought if the case had been successful her mother could have become the first person in the world to become pregnant using a dead daughter's eggs.<\/p><p>In February 2016, when seeking permission to appeal, her lawyers argued there was \"clear evidence\" of what the daughter wanted to happen to her eggs when she died.  <\/p><h2>'Prospect of success'<\/h2><p>Lord Justice Treacy said the case papers had left him doubtful as to whether there would be \"sufficiently strong\" reasons to allow the challenge to continue further. <\/p><p>But after hearing submissions in court, he concluded there was \"an arguable case with a real prospect of success\".<\/p>\n

This abnormal release leads can cause weight loss by making the body break down proteins and fat.<\/p><p>High energy foods can help people to maintain their weight, but Dr Shaw notes that it is sometimes hard to know what to eat. <\/p><p>Many of her patients eat a lot of soup. <\/p><p>\"It's liquid, it goes down easily, it's a prime choice. But, as a dietician, I will often talk to them about the fact that soup is often low in energy, and it's often low in protein. <\/p><p>\"So people might be using it as a replacement for a meal, but it's not providing the same nourishment as a meal.' <\/p><p>Other high energy meals such as roasted chicken, or more nutritious soups, are advised. <\/p><h2>Soft is best<\/h2><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Ginger\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/media\/images\/81449000\/jpg\/_81449998_ginger.jpg\" data-width=\"624\" data-height=\"351\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    Ginger is often recommended for patients - but doesn't suit all\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>People being treated for cancer often find it difficult to eat due to a sore or dry mouth or throat and difficulty swallowing whilst undergoing treatment<\/p><p>That's because the digestive system is lined with a soft layer of tissue called the mucous membrane.

It says people can be driven to doing it because they think the physical symptoms of self-poisoning and other types of self-injury, such as cutting themselves, will be easier to cope with than their emotional pain. <\/p><p>But charities say self harm doesn't actually alleviate suffering, and although self-poisoners don't want to kill themselves, they put themselves at risk of serious injury and death. <\/p><hr><h2>What is self-poisoning?<\/h2><ul><li>It is a type of self-harm, normally triggered by anxiety or depression<\/li>\n<li>Doctors say people tend to cut themselves as a way of trying to cope with difficulty in their lives, while self-poisoning can happen to those who feel they can no longer cope<\/li>\n<li>If someone deliberately poisons themselves, it does not always mean they are trying to end their life<\/li>\n<\/ul><hr><p>Ashton, who is 20 years old, says she gets the urge to self-injure three or four times a week.

It's a lot easier to describe your symptoms when you feel physically sick - you don't have to explain them to people in the same way as feeling bad emotionally.

I began to realise that learning to love myself again was really important.\"<\/p><p>Sarah, who has scars from cutting herself and suffered some liver damage from self-poisoning, also took up yoga. \"I needed to learn to love my body, as well as my mind and yoga helped me with that,\" she says. \"Aspects like learning how to breathe better helped me to relax.\"<\/p><p>In February Sarah celebrated a full year without self-poisoning. She continues to practise yoga and hopes, in the future, to speak to teenagers about how they can also overcome it. \"It's not easy,\" she says, \"but it can be done.\"<\/p><hr><p>If you have concerns about the issues dealt with in this article, these organisations offer advice and information:<\/p><p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lifesigns.org.uk\/\">Life Signs<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.harmless.org.uk\/\">Harmless<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.youngminds.org.uk\/\">Young Minds<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.mind.org.uk\/\">Mind<\/a><\/p><p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.samaritans.org\/\">Samaritans<\/a><\/p><hr><p><i>Black and white photographs by Phil Coomes<\/i><\/p><p><i>Subscribe to the <\/i><a href=\"https:\/\/ssl.bbc.co.uk\/newsletters\/newsmagazine?ptrt=http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/magazine\">BBC News Magazine's email newsletter<\/a><i> to get articles sent to your inbox.<\/i><\/p>\n                                                                                                <\/div>\n"},"Are there still taboos around childbirth?":{"link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/health-36229822#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa","description":"Are there still taboos surrounding childbirth?","content":"<div property=\"articleBody\" contentScore=\"4215\">\n                                                                                                    <figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Newborn baby\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/179DF\/production\/_89653769_newborn.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>Thinkstock<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n        <\/figure><p>Many mothers' birth plans end up in the bin, with their baby born via an emergency Caesarean or with labour induced.

Surely in 21st Century Britain we should, by now, understand as much about the organs that start life as much as those that support it.<\/p><p>One thing is very clear - this lack of research funding cannot be explained by a lack of need. <\/p><p>Across England and Wale more than 55,000 babies were born too early in 2014.  Preterm birth is common, affecting about 8% of pregnancies and is the leading cause of death in newborn babies, as well as increasing the likelihood of serious long-term health problems to surviving babies. <\/p><p>Yet we are largely in the dark about preventing it.  <\/p><h2>Real risk<\/h2><p>Over 100,000 women will have births that need medical or surgical intervention. <\/p><p>The leading cause of emergency C-sections is that the muscle of the uterus gets tired - this is dangerous because without the muscle contracting, the baby cannot be delivered through the birth canal. <\/p><p>There is just one drug, which was introduced 50 years ago, that can be offered to help women suffering these labours, which are termed \"failure to progress\". And that one drug works only half the time.  <\/p><p>We can neither predict which women will have these difficult labours, nor which will not respond to the drug, and need surgery. <\/p><p>Such labours are common, affecting one in 10 births and can be enormously traumatic for the women involved. <\/p><p>Many often decide against subsequent children or elect to have a C-section, with its small but nevertheless real risk. <\/p><p>Only awareness and more funding for research in these areas can start to make these stark figures better, and make women's birth plans less of a wish list.  <\/p><p>Mothers will have choice only when we improve the scientific base to understand difficult pregnancies and births, and increase the chances of them being able to have the healthy birth they want for their baby.<\/p>\n                                                                                                <\/div>\n"},"'My brother was let down badly'":{"link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/health-36330257#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa","description":"My brother's brain injury was ignored because of dementia","content":"<div property=\"articleBody\" contentScore=\"6095\">\n                                                                                                    <figure><span>\n                \n                <img alt=\"Philip Blewett next to a hot air balloon\" src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/17B3B\/production\/_89738079_tew01004215_00386.jpg\" width=\"976\" height=\"549\"><span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>George and Lilian Blewett<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    Before the accident, Philip was an active person, living independently and enjoying life, his family says\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The family of a man with mild dementia who was seriously injured in a road traffic accident says people living with the condition are being let down badly and not given the urgent medical care they need.<\/p><p>Philip Blewett was diagnosed with early Alzheimer's disease in 2013 at the age of 64. <\/p><p>George, his older brother, says he was living a very full life - \"you would hardly have known about the diagnosis\".<\/p><p>Philip was living on his own, happily managing his own affairs.

also called for the Barnett Formula to be scrapped.<\/p><p>The formula, which is used to distribute funds across the different parts of the UK, should be replaced by a new needs-based system, their

\"inattentive approach to the integrity of the Union cannot continue\", with the Lords calling for any further plans to transfer power out of Westminster to be \"considered within an appropriate framework of constitutional principles that safeguard the integrity of the Union\".<\/p><p>In future, a \"Devolution Impact Assessment\" could be published, examining the potential impact of proposals on the \"cohesiveness and stability of the Union as a whole, and on each of its constituent nations\".<\/p>                                                                                                    <p>Ministers have also been urged to adopt a new approach to devolution, with the report saying: \"A new mindset is required at all levels of government - one that recognises the devolved institutions as now being established components of the UK's constitution.<\/p><p>\"This new mindset will require abandoning a 'devolve and forget' attitude.<\/p><p>\"Instead, the UK government should engage with the devolved institutions across the whole breadth of government policy, co-operating and collaborating where possible. <\/p><p>\"In particular, the Joint Ministerial Committee should be reformed to promote co-operation and collaboration, rather than grandstanding and gesture politics.\"<\/p><h2>'Group of cronies'<\/h2><p>The report also said it was \"too soon to know\" whether English Votes for English Laws (Evel) and \"devolution deals\" - where local authorities are given greater power - would provide an answer to the \"English question\", which has left the largest part of the UK as the only part without its own assembly.<\/p><p>Responding to the report, SNP MP Pete Wishart claimed the committee had shown a \"spectacular failure to grasp devolution\".<\/p><p>He added: \"This House of Lords report is irrelevant and adds nothing to the debate.

Attempted to shake-off his \"Red Ed\" tag by talking about the \"squeezed middle\" - but faced criticism the party lacked direction.<\/p>\r\n        <p>He launched a two-year policy review and consultation exercise on \"refounding\" Labour as a more modern and inclusive party. He faced criticism his leadership lacked edge, but won support over his reaction to the phone-hacking scandal - and his decision to burn the party's bridges with Rupert Murdoch's media empire. <\/p>\r\n        <p>The son of a Marxist intellectual and an MP since 2005, he was formerly an adviser to Gordon Brown. After entering Parliament, he enjoyed a rapid rise, becoming energy and climate change secretary in 2008. Married his long-term partner and mother of his two young children, Justine Thornton in 2011.<\/p>\r\n  \r\n<h2 id=\"heading-2\">ED BALLS - SHADOW CHANCELLOR<\/h2>\r\n      <p>As Gordon Brown's chief economic adviser, he was at the chancellor's side for many years. After being elected an MP in 2005, he quickly became a Treasury minister but had to deny accusations of briefing against Tony Blair. Later he became schools secretary and narrowly held on to his seat in the 2010 election after being targeted by the Tories. Came third in the Labour leadership contest and was named shadow home secretary, despite being tipped for shadow chancellor. His public calls for Labour to change its position on the deficit were widely seen as having lost him the job. However, following Alan Johnson's resignation in January 2011, Mr Balls, <a href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/democracylive\/hi\/representatives\/profiles\/19497.stm\">at the age of 44<\/a>, became shadow chancellor after all. Married to shadow cabinet colleague Yvette Cooper. <\/p>\r\n  \r\n<h2 id=\"heading-3\">YVETTE COOPER - SHADOW HOME SECRETARY AND MINISTER FOR WOMEN AND EQUALITIES<\/h2>\r\n      <p>Popular throughout the party, the then <a href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/democracylive\/hi\/representatives\/profiles\/25691.stm\">42-year old<\/a> got the most votes of any MP in the shadow cabinet elections. A former journalist with the Independent, she was marked out early on as a rising star after being elected in 1997. Two years later, at the age of 30, she became a minister - the youngest at the time. She rose quickly up the ministerial ladder, working in the Treasury before becoming work and pensions secretary. Was urged by some to run for the leadership but decided against it, saying it was not the right time. Another of those seen as a potential shadow chancellor, she was in fact appointed shadow foreign secretary in Ed Miliband's first front bench line-up, but moved to the home affairs brief after Alan Johnson's resignation. Married to Ed Balls - they are the first married couple to serve as cabinet ministers at the same time. They have three children. <\/p>\r\n  \r\n<h2 id=\"heading-4\">DOUGLAS ALEXANDER - SHADOW FOREIGN SECRETARY <\/h2>\r\n      <p>The former solicitor is one of only a handful of senior Labour figures who were close to both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. Once Gordon Brown's speechwriter, he served as Scottish secretary and transport secretary under Tony Blair and international development secretary under Gordon Brown. Blamed by some for the election that never was in 2007 after urging Gordon Brown to call a snap poll. <a href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/democracylive\/hi\/representatives\/profiles\/25705.stm\">Aged 43<\/a>, he co-ordinated the 2010 Labour general election campaign. Backed David Miliband in the leadership contest, chairing his campaign. <\/p>\r\n  \r\n<h2 id=\"heading-5\">TRISTRAM HUNT - SHADOW EDUCATION SECRETARY<\/h2>\r\n      <p>Historian Tristram Hunt, MP for Stoke-on-Trent Central since 2010, was promoted from shadow minister to shadow education secretary in the October 2013 reshuffle. He replaced Stephen Twigg. Mr Hunt is best known as a regular newspaper columnist, broadcaster and history lecturer. After taking a first-class degree in history from Cambridge University, he served as an exchange fellow at the University of Chicago before returning to Cambridge to complete his doctorate. He went on to work for Tony Blair in the Labour Party HQ on the 1997 General Election campaign and became a special adviser to former Science Minister Lord Sainsbury.<\/p>\r\n  \r\n<h2 id=\"heading-6\">ANDY BURNHAM - SHADOW HEALTH SECRETARY<\/h2>\r\n      <p><a href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/democracylive\/hi\/representatives\/profiles\/25787.stm\">Turning 40<\/a> in 2010, Burnham was the youngest candidate in the Labour leadership contest, in which he came fourth. During the campaign, he argued that Labour had lost touch with its grass roots supporters and been dazzled by wealth. Like many senior figures in the party, he is a former special adviser. He rose quickly through the ranks after becoming an MP, serving as chief secretary to the Treasury, culture secretary and health secretary. He is a keen football player and avid Everton fan. Looked after education in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet before returning to his previous love, health in 2011. <\/p>\r\n  \r\n<h2 id=\"heading-7\">HARRIET HARMAN - DEPUTY LEADER AND SHADOW CULTURE SECRETARY<\/h2>\r\n      <p>Labour's deputy leader, she took over from Gordon Brown as acting leader in May 2010, capping a remarkable political comeback after she was sacked from Tony Blair's first cabinet in 1998 in a row over welfare reform. She worked her way back into favour and held a number of ministerial positions, including solicitor general, before beating Alan Johnson to the deputy leadership in 2007, at the <a href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/democracylive\/hi\/representatives\/profiles\/25677.stm\">age of 56<\/a>. A longstanding campaigner for women's rights, she led a drive while in government to have domestic violence taken more seriously. Widely commended for her Commons performances as acting leader. Swapped briefs with Ivan Lewis in October 2011, having previously spoken on international development. <\/p>\r\n  \r\n<h2 id=\"heading-8\">RACHEL REEVES - SHADOW WORK AND PENSIONS SECRETARY<\/h2>\r\n      <p>Shortly after returning from maternity leave she was promoted in October 2013 from the post of shadow treasury secretary having been shadow pensions minister in Ed Miliband's first shadow cabinet. <a href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/democracylive\/hi\/representatives\/profiles\/35872.stm\">The MP for Leeds West<\/a> was first elected to Parliament at the age of 31 in 2010. A former Bank of England economist, Ms Reeves quickly became a strong voice in opposition and penned an entry in the Purple Book - produced by Lord Mandelson's Progress group - warning that Labour should address the UK's poor rates of saving with targeted tax relief. Oxford and LSE-educated, she also worked at the British Embassy in Washington and at Halifax Bank of Scotland before entering Parliament.<\/p>\r\n  \r\n<h2 id=\"heading-9\">CHUKA UMUNNA - SHADOW BUSINESS SECRETARY<\/h2>\r\n      <p>A <a href=\"http:\/\/news.bbc.co.uk\/democracylive\/hi\/representatives\/profiles\/72314.stm\">former employment lawyer<\/a> turned MP for the London constituency of Streatham, Mr Umunna has seen his stock rise inexorably since he was elected in 2010. A former PPS to Ed Miliband, he's already been a shadow business minister and also sat on the powerful Treasury select committee. He has attacked the coalition government for not doing enough to foster bank lending through its Project Merlin agreement. Just 31 when elected, he is already been talked of as a potential future leader. <\/p>\r\n  \r\n<h2 id=\"heading-10\">HILARY BENN - SHADOW COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT SECRETARY<\/h2>\r\n      <p>As the son of former Labour Cabinet minister Tony Benn, the MP for Leeds Central is part of a political dynasty.

But if - like them - you accept predictions that leaving the EU would cut economic growth, it is hard to imagine that would not hit the public finances. Such a scenario would require spending to be cut further, taxes to be increased or the period of austerity to be extended.<\/p><p>The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has released a report suggesting that the UK leaving the European Union could lead to austerity being extended by two years.<\/p><p>How did it get to that figure?<\/p><p>First of all, the IFS did not do its own economic modelling of the impact of a Brexit on the economy. Instead it used the National Institute of Economic and Social Research's <a href=\"http:\/\/www.niesr.ac.uk\/media\/economic-impact-leaving-eu-12503#.V0RcJ_krK71\">model<\/a>, which predicted that leaving the EU would lead to GDP in 2030 being between 1.5% and 7.8% lower than it would have been the UK stayed in the EU, depending on what sort of relationship ended up being negotiated with the single market.<\/p><div id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n    <div>\n        \n    <\/div>\n<\/div><p>The IFS actually says that the extra period of austerity would be between one and two years.<\/p><p>Its research has suggested that a 1% decline in in GDP increases borrowing for the government by 0.7% of GDP.<\/p><p>So, at the optimistic end of the NIESR predictions, in which the UK becomes part of the European Economic Area post-Brexit, the IFS reckons that in 2019-20, when the Chancellor wants to have a \u00a310.4bn economic surplus, we would actually have a \u00a317bn deficit. It says that the UK would need an extra 1.1 years of austerity at the current pace to turn around that deficit.<\/p>                                                                                                    <p>At the other end of the scale, NIESR's pessimistic forecast - in which the UK ends up trading under World Trade Organisation rules without special relationships with any other nation - the forecast is for a \u00a328bn deficit, which would take an extra two years to return to the \u00a310.4bn surplus.<\/p><h2>Following past trends<\/h2><p>So is all this convincing? First, it suffers from the same uncertainties involved in all economic forecasting, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-35862618\">which we have discussed in the past.<\/a><\/p><p>Second, the relationship of a 1% decline in GDP knocking 0.7% of GDP off the government's finances is an average based on past experience, caused by reduced tax revenue and increased demand for benefits; it will not necessarily happen like that in future. <\/p><p>The IFS sets out some of the reasons why the relationship may not be followed precisely.

The Labour Party has been doing it for decades (remember \"24 hours to save the NHS?\"). This ad claims the NHS is at \"breaking point\".<\/p><p>The central claim is that the UK sends \u00a3350m a week to the EU, a figure that has been <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-eu-referendum-36040060\">disputed by the BBC's Reality Check<\/a> and many others. And if we were to leave the EU it seems very unlikely that the money saved would be spent on building a \"brand new hospital every week\".<\/p><p>If you watch the broadcast carefully, there is wriggle room. \"We <i>could<\/i> spend the money on our priorities, <i>like<\/i> the NHS\" (my italics). <\/p><p>But the casual viewer (is there any other kind for election broadcasts?) would get the impression from this broadcast that the only way to save the NHS is to vote to leave on 23 June.

Both point to a recession in the short term, but in the case of the lesser \"shock\" scenario, while there would be an impact on the economy, the predicted recession would be very mild and well within the bounds of forecasting uncertainty. <\/p><p>The Treasury has released its analysis of the short-term effects of a vote to leave the European Union - that's what would happen in the two years after 23 June.<\/p><p>And it's not pretty - <a href=\"https:\/\/www.gov.uk\/government\/uploads\/system\/uploads\/attachment_data\/file\/524967\/hm_treasury_analysis_the_immediate_economic_impact_of_leaving_the_eu_web.pdf\">the Treasury predicts<\/a> that economic growth would decline, wages would be lower than if we'd stayed in and house prices would fall.<\/p><p>If you're prepared to be influenced by economic modelling (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/business-35862618\">read our Reality Check on the subject here<\/a>) then there is a simple message, which is that in the first two years, a vote to leave the EU would be a considerably bad thing for the economy.<\/p><div id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n    <div>\n        \n    <\/div>\n<\/div><p>If you want to go a bit further into the figures, there is more to say.<\/p><p>The Treasury no longer does economic forecasts - that job has now been given to the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).<\/p><p>What the Treasury is doing is what it calls scenario analysis, which is taking what would happen if we stayed in the EU as a base-line and then considering what the impact would be were we to leave.<\/p>                                                                                                    <p>So all the figures you see today are not how much worse things would be than they are today. They are how much worse things will be in two years if we leave the EU, than they would have been if we stayed in.<\/p><h2>'That's a recession'<\/h2><p>The Treasury has modelled two scenarios, the \"shock\" and the \"severe shock\" scenarios.<\/p><p>The shock scenario is what it reckons would happen if the country decided to negotiate a bilateral agreement to cover its relationship with the EU. The severe shock scenario is what would happen if we decided to trade as just another World Trade Organisation member, with no special relationship with the EU.<\/p><p>The Chancellor said in his speech: \"Within two years the size of our economy - our GDP - would be at least 3% smaller as a result of leaving the EU - and it could be as much as 6% smaller.\"<\/p><p>\"We'd have a year of negative growth - that's a recession.\"<\/p><p>But that doesn't mean it will be smaller than it is now, it means it will be smaller than it would have been had we stayed in.<\/p><p>If you compare that with the OBR's forecast for what will happen to the economy over the next couple of years (assuming we stay in) it turns out that under the shock scenario, in the first four quarters after the vote to leave, the economy would contract by 0.1% every quarter. <\/p><p>A recession is when you get at least two consecutive quarters (three month periods) in which the economy gets smaller. So that would be a recession, but not by very much. It would be well within the degree of uncertainty surrounding this sort of economic analysis.<\/p><p>Under the severe shock scenario, the expected contraction would be much more severe: - 1% in the first quarter and -0.4% in the following three quarters, before registering negligible growth in the following year.<\/p><p>The same may be done with other predictions in the report. <\/p><p>For example, the Treasury predicts house prices in two years would be between 10% and 18% lower than they would be if we had stayed in. The OBR forecasts house prices will rise by about 10% over that period, so if you put those predictions together for the two scenarios you get prices being either flat or falling by 8%.<\/p><hr><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"EU Referendum Reality Check\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/A862\/production\/_88460134_index_promo976.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"280\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n        <\/figure><p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/live\/uk-politics-eu-referendum-35603388\">Read more: The facts behind claims in the EU debate<\/a><\/p><hr><\/div>\n"},"Blair gives insight into Iraq response":{"link":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-politics-36371101#sa-ns_mchannel=rss&ns_source=PublicRSS20-sa","description":"Blair hints at Chilcot response","content":"<div property=\"articleBody\" contentScore=\"2601\">\n                                                                                                    <figure><span>\n                \n                <img alt=\"Tony Blair speaking at an event in London\" src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/8942\/production\/_89783153_89783152.jpg\" width=\"976\" height=\"549\"><span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>PA<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    Tony Blair says the West faces a profound test of political will if it is to defeat jihaddism\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>Tony Blair didn't utter the C word - he won't comment on the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war until the report is published on 6 July.<\/p><p>But at an event in central London organised by the Centre on Religion and Geopolitics - a think tank which he helped to set up - he made it clear he would be unapologetic for his role in taking Britain to war in 2003.<\/p><p>He certainly hadn't drawn the lesson that western military intervention in the Middle East was counter-productive. He talked of a \"generational struggle\" against so-called Islamic State, saying \"we are not being honest with our public if we are saying it is possible to defeat these people without making the commitment to defeat them and to do what it takes to defeat them\". <\/p><p>For him, that was likely to require Western boots on the ground:<\/p><p>\"You have got to defeat these people on the ground.

But how rare are these striking-looking crustaceans, asks Justin Parkinson.<\/p><p>Lobsters caught off the Atlantic coast of North America aren't usually very bright. They tend to be a murky, greeny-brown... until they are boiled, when they turn the orangey-pink familiar to diners with high disposable incomes.<\/p><p>So two fishermen off the coast of Nova Scotia made the news when they caught <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ctvnews.ca\/canada\/once-in-a-blue-lobster-two-rare-blue-crustaceans-caught-in-n-s-1.2913359\">not one, but two<\/a> vivid blue lobsters in quick succession, 150km (93 miles) apart. Among the region's fishermen, it's traditionally considered to be a sign of good fortune.<\/p><p>The probability of the creature having this colouring is widely touted as being one in two million. The <a href=\"http:\/\/umaine.edu\/lobsterinstitute\/files\/2011\/12\/LobsterColorsWeb.pdf\">University of Maine Lobster Institute<\/a> is among those to have quoted these odds in the past, though its executive director, Rob Bayer, admits they are merely a \"guess\".<\/p><p>\"The chances of this happening nobody really knows,\" he says.<\/p><div id=\"bbccom_mpu_1_2_3\" aria-hidden=\"true\">\n    <div>\n        \n    <\/div>\n<\/div><aside><div>\n<h2>The answer<\/h2>\n<ul><li>It's been suggested that the odds are one in two million<\/li>\n<li>But these are largely a \"guess\", according to the US Lobster Institute<\/li>\n<\/ul><\/div><\/aside><p>David Spiegelhalter, professor for the public understanding of risk at Cambridge University in the UK, is inclined to pour a bit of cold water on the story.<\/p><p>A rough analysis of overall catch tonnages suggests that about 200 million lobsters are caught in the North Atlantic every year, he says. That equates to 100 blue ones turning up in a year on average, if the one-in-two-million odds are correct.<\/p><p>\"So for two to be caught three days apart, quite close to each other, does not seem at all surprising,\" says Spiegelhalter. \"I would imagine it happens most years.\"<\/p>                                                                                                    <p>Bright blue lobsters are so-coloured because of a genetic abnormality that causes them to produce more of a certain protein than others. <\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"A regular European lobster, and (right) a blue one caught in Scotland in 2011\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/A530\/production\/_89788224_electric-blue_european976.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"670\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>Science Photo Library<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    A normal European lobster, and (right) a blue one caught in Scotland in 2011\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>They stand out from the rest of a catch, particularly in western parts of the North Atlantic.<\/p><p>\"The American lobster is usually a sort of greeny-brown, so anything bright blue would look very odd to fishermen there,\" says Charlie Ellis, a researcher at the UK's National Lobster Hatchery, in Cornwall. <\/p><p>\"But European lobsters tend to be a duller blue colour. The real sort of iridescent blue is still rare here, but the difference is that, to a European fisherman, it will seem less completely out of the ordinary than it would seem to a North American.\"<\/p><p>Ellis thinks the probability of a lobster being bright blue may be as low as one in a few hundred thousand. But another British expert, Andrew Parker of Oxford University's zoology department, disagrees - he backs the one-in-two-million estimate.<\/p><p>It's safe to say that other kinds of lobster are even rarer. Yellow lobsters account for about one in 30 million of total stocks, the Lobster Institute estimates. <\/p><p>But two fishermen in Dorset hit the ultimate lobster-probability jackpot in 2011 when they <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/uk-england-dorset-16142270\">caught an albino, or \"crystal\", lobster<\/a> - the odds of this are reckoned to be one in 100 million.<\/p><p>\"Whatever the odds of catching different-coloured lobsters, there's no denying that bright blue ones are truly beautiful creatures,\" says Bayer. \"They might not be the most unusual, but they are undoubtedly the best to look at.\"<\/p><p>One of the Canadian blue lobsters has already been returned to the sea. The other will be kept in a tank and released after the end of the lobster season in mid-July.<\/p><p><strong>Follow Justin Parkinson on Twitter <\/strong><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/JustParkinson\">@justparkinson<\/a><\/p><p><i>Subscribe to the <\/i><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/magazine-26567792\">BBC News Magazine's email newsletter<\/a><i> to get articles sent to your inbox.<\/i><\/p>\n                                                                                                <\/div>\n"}}
