The 5s is nearly three years old and Indian buyers, though price-conscious, have not shown much interest in buying old models.  <\/p><p>Apple, therefore, has a problem. Its newer models are expensive and its cheaper models are too old to be interesting for Indian buyers.<\/p><h2>Refurbished phones<\/h2><p>One answer is refurbished phones, which Apple sells in other markets. It calls them \"pre-owned and certified\", explaining that these are current models, often returned by a customer. These models go back to the factory to be tested and certified. They emerge with a new identity (an IMEI number) and warranty.<\/p><p>Analysts say this could be a winner for Apple because Indian buyers will be more willing to buy such phones at a discount.<\/p><p>Selling refurbished current models will increase Apple's share of the 15,000 to 30,000-rupee segment, which accounted for 5.6% of the smartphone market in the first quarter of 2016, according to CMR analyst Faisal Kawoosa. <\/p><p>\"With the brand equity of Apple, it can easily grab over 40% of this segment, almost doubling its sales,\" he says.<\/p><p>\"This could take Apple to selling four million units in 2016 in India.\"  <\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"An Indian woman talks on her mobile phone as she walks past the logo of the iPhone 4 during its launch by provider Aircel in Hyderabad on May 27, 2011.\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/776D\/production\/_89737503_50accb23-d0b7-41a3-8797-d63977393f52.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"600\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>Getty Images<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    Older iPhone models are cheaper, but their sale is low in India\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>There is a problem, though. <\/p><p>The government may not allow Apple to sell refurbished phones in India, citing concerns about \"dumping of old models\" and \"e-waste\". <\/p><p>Industry insiders say this appears to be a result of intense lobbying by rival handset vendors with the government to disallow Apple from selling refurbished phones.

Detaching easily from a surface was another challenge; if perching was the only goal, Mr Graule said, \"we could have put a little glue on top of the robot\".  <\/p><p>To solve these problems, the researchers designed a small, flat \"landing patch\" with an electrostatic charge that can be switched on and off. <\/p><p>When switched on, the patch acquires a negative charge that makes it stick to nearby, more positively charged surfaces.<\/p><p>You can experience a similar effect by \"rubbing a balloon on your hair then sticking it to a wall,\" explained principal investigator of the Harvard RoboBee project, Dr Robert Wood. And for the dismount, said Dr Wood, \"[we] simply remove power to the patch\". <\/p><p>What the team is most excited about though are the opportunities that such minuscule component parts promise for other applications.

We want our hands to be able to do more; that's why we have hammers. <\/p><p>VR allows us to go beyond the limitations of physical tools to do anything that can be computed. If you want to create a two-mile high tower made out of toothpicks, you can do it. <\/p><p>I did a series of 14 different environments; one where you felt like you were very high and had to look down: that was the first time people found this sense of vertigo within a virtual environment. I did a world where you look up towards the sky and see fireworks exploding; that's just magical. <\/p>                                                                                                    <p>I wanted to build a tool so people could use it. The best way to do that was to stay away from the consumer market because it really wasn't ready, and to go after industrial uses. <\/p><p>So my company created a viewing system that actually meets the specs of modern VR. <\/p><p>Because it had such high resolution, commercial users could use it to solve real problems. <\/p><p>Automobile companies used it for car design. Oil and gas industry used it to visualise data to figure out the right place to sink a well. <\/p><p>The next step was to make these cheap. Consumer VR up until then had a really narrow field of view; it was like looking through a tube of paper. Peripheral vision is really important for a visceral sense, and that's what people really react to. <\/p><p>To find a way to make it low cost and still retain that field of view, we harnessed the power of mobile phones - the screens, tracking and processing - and we figured out a lens design that was extremely inexpensive.<\/p><p>It's been really fun playing all these years, but there's something more important now, which is making it a space that allows us to harness our emotions, our desire to connect with people.<\/p><p>I'm worried by our current computer interfaces. I watch people walking around like zombies with cell phones in their hands, and I have to manoeuvre a mouse to fill out little boxes on web forms in a horribly frustrating way. I think VR will allow us to transcend this. <\/p><p>I don't worry so much about where VR is going, I worry about where we currently are.<\/p><hr><h2>Maria Korolov: Work, rest and play<\/h2><p><i>Maria Korolov is a technology journalist who has devoted her career to writing about virtual reality. <\/i><\/p><p>The biggest way [VR is changing the workplace] is training and simulations.

Google has been seeding elementary schools with over 100,000 virtual reality headsets and lesson plans. Kids are able to go on a virtual reality field trip to, say, the surface of the moon.<\/p><p>Gamers want something visceral. When you're riding a roller-coaster and you go down a hill, your stomach drops out: even though you know it's not real, your body reacts as if it's there. When I showed a shark simulation to people and they screamed, I laughed because, \"Ha ha, they're not real.\" Then I put it on and the shark came at me and I screamed, because it's a physical reaction. <\/p><p>The adult industry is jumping into this with everything they've got because it is so compelling. I have sampled it purely from a reviewer perspective, and it felt like you were in a locker room, and you don't know where to look because everyone's naked, and the lights are too bright, and they're interacting with you. This is going to be big. <\/p><p>The way the internet has changed the way we communicate information, virtual reality will change the way we communicate experiences. <\/p><p>If I wanted to show you what it's like to cook a meal, I could invite you to my virtual apartment and take you through a virtual cooking class. If I wanted to experience a walk in the woods with you, I could take you to my favourite virtual woods.<\/p><p>It will make the world even smaller than it is now.

I recently travelled to Iraq to interview former ISIS fighters \u2014people who just weeks ago had volunteered to be suicide bombers. <\/p><p>I learned that when aspiring fighters arrive at ISIS's headquarters in Raqqa, Syria, they are forced to give up two of their most prized possessions, their passport and their mobile phone \u2014 symbols of their physical and digital mobility.<\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"IS fighters in Raqqa in 2014\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/15824\/production\/_89700188_raqqa.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>AP<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    So-called Islamic State fighters have to give up their mobile phones in Raqqa\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>The former fighters described life in the caliphate in stark contrast to the common ISIS narrative of a group of noble warriors fighting for Muslims' rights. The recruits couldn't speak freely, move freely, or use technology. <\/p><p>They were prisoners in every sense. Once the new joiners completed their six weeks of obligatory religious and military training, they got their phones back. <\/p><p>The defectors I spoke with were the lucky ones. They had contacts in a nearby military force who coordinated their escape. <\/p><p>Most people aren't so lucky. If my interviews are any indication, there are many young people who know immediately upon arrival in the caliphate that they have made a huge mistake and that they want to leave, but they don't know how. <\/p><p>They do, however, have access to a mobile phone and wi-fi. It would be a mistake not to exploit this opportunity to reach disaffected members of ISIS.<\/p><h2>'Fundamental right'<\/h2><p>Although these examples illustrate seemingly isolated cases of life under severe censorship or the deprivation of information, pro-democracy think tank Freedom House reports that, two thirds of the world faces some type of repression. <\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"Computer keyboard\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/18380\/production\/_89700299_thinkstockphotos-489773763.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n                 <span>Image copyright<\/span>\n                 <span>Thinkstock<\/span>\n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    Some repressive governments are using the internet as a weapon\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>And more governments than ever are censoring information that is in the public's interest.<\/p><p>It's easy to take each of the above examples as isolated cases, or to make excuses for such oppression as the result of cultural differences.

the route boarded the bus quickly and easily, taking advantage of the new cashless payment system. <\/p><p>There were no delays or arguments about change, the kind you are almost guaranteed to

African countries but I have to say Rwanda moved fast. They have a strong anti-corruption drive and the country has been growing at about 8% per annum for the last few years.\" <\/p><p>Back in the centre of Kigali, I visit FabLab, an innovation hub at the government-backed Information and Communication Technology (ICT) park, which is expected to receive $150m (\u00a3105m) of investment. <\/p><figure><span>\n                \n                \n                <div data-alt=\"man looks at computer\" data-src=\"http:\/\/ichef-1.bbci.co.uk\/news\/320\/cpsprodpb\/11448\/production\/_89682707_89682706.jpg\" data-width=\"976\" data-height=\"549\"><\/div>\n                \n                \n            <\/span>\n            \n            <figcaption><span>Image caption<\/span>\n                <span>\n                    3D printers are among the emerging technologies being promoted at the ICT park\n                <\/span>\n            <\/figcaption><\/figure><p>There I met young tech entrepreneurs working on 3D and laser printers. <\/p><p>Amongst them a familiar face is being shown around the room.

One of the key challenges is the country's low internet penetration. <\/p><p>According to the most recent figures, 13% of Rwandans are online. But the government has published ambitious plans to increase that to 95% by the end of 2016, with the planned rollout of a 4G mobile network. <\/p><p>As Anne Jellema, chief executive of the Web Foundation, which is working to extend the \"basic right\" of connectivity to people across the world, tells me:<\/p><p>\"Everyone deserves to be connected to fast, affordable, safe and transparent Internet.
